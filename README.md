## Usage

To run the sentiment analysis on airline customer reviews:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed by following the [Installation](#installation) instructions.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks/` folder:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/Airline_Customer_Review_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
    ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, and perform the sentiment analysis.
4. Visualize the results to identify areas for service improvement based on customer sentiment.

## Results

The results of the sentiment analysis provide insights into the common themes and sentiments in customer reviews. These results can help airlines:
- Identify customer pain points
- Improve services where negative sentiment is dominant
- Track sentiment trends over time

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements for this project include:
- Integrating more advanced NLP models like BERT or GPT for better sentiment classification.
- Expanding the analysis to cover more airlines and languages.
- Creating an interactive dashboard for real-time sentiment monitoring.
