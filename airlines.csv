american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,H Chisnall,United Kingdom,8/1/2015,Our flight from MAN to JFK was cancelled due to engine issues which resulted in us having to rebook and we ended up flying via LHR. Our rebooked flight was with British Airways which was much better as they offered individual inflight entertainment systems unlike American who are still on an old system of overhead TVs. Our flight back from JFK was delayed and when we eventually got on board the aeroplane was quite possibly the oldest plane I have been on with a cabin crew to match. After 10 minutes the pilot informed us that a member of American Airlines staff had attempted to open the cabin door when it had already been locked which resulted in the life raft falling off the plane! We had to all disembark and after an hours wait we were told our flight was cancelled and we would need to rebook. We were put on flight the next day via Dublin which resulted us being over 24 hours late home. Appalling service and we will never travel with them again.,,Couple Leisure,Economy,Manchester to JFK New York,1,1,1,,,1,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Jill Halligan,United States,7/31/2015,"We flew from Boston, MA to St. Thomas U.S.V.I. on July 14th 2015. Flight #1619 from Boston to Miami was our first leg of the trip and that went smoothly. Then we got onto flight #2421 from Miami to St. Thomas. It was delayed a half hour. We landed in St. Thomas still being able to make our ferry to Tortola. However, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes for all of our luggage to be deplaned. During this time three other planes landed, all of their luggage was sorted out and the passengers from those planes left the terminal. We found one of our pieces of luggage was still in Miami. Our flight came in at 3.30pm, originally supposed to land at 2.57pm. It is well know that ferries stop running from Charlotte Amalie at 4.30pm. American should have done everything in its power to get people on their way. At least one third of the passengers were in the same situation as us. Four others lost baggage. My son spent the next morning trying to reconnect with his luggage and were told we would have to make a trip to the ferry terminal to pick it up. Now on to our flight home, July 25th 2015, we arrive at the airport three hours before our flight. The six of us were flying from St. Thomas to Philadelphia, PA on flight 837 leaving at 3.05pm. We arrived at the airport at 11.45am. We went to the kiosk and got our plane tickets and then joined the extremely long line (1.5 hours), at the ticket counter, just to get our luggage tags.",Boeing 757,FamilyLeisure,Economy,Boston to St. Thomas via Miami,3,4,4,3,4,1,,2,0

The individual reverse herringbone seats on the 777 are second to none. Privacy and sleeping space are guaranteed. The entertainment is good enough and the flight crew professional and even friendly to some extent. The one downside was the food, which was not only below what one would expect for J and not very tasty either. In the transcon similar experience. The full lie flat in J is a nice touch, and even getting over the other passenger is not a problem at all.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Kelli O'Donnell,United States,7/29/2015,"This review is about their ridiculous process to get credited for miles on their and their partners flights. Last week, it took me all of ten minutes to ask United to credit me for flights I flew on SAS Airlines, and all of two days to credit my account. I flew Iberia Airlines in November - filled out my request for miles from American in December - didn't hear anything by March. So I asked again, and now I have been asked for receipt, name, boarding passes, and advantage number - three of which I have provided, and the receipt is really moot at this point. Honestly, I believe this whole issue is because I have an apostrophe in my last name.

I paid 178.00 cash to buy three thousand aadvantage miles for a $200 ticket, due to all the fees, they even rewarded me 5,000 miles for my purchase. Every single customer service rep I spoke with told me I should read all their fine print online to add up the fees prior to booking. I could not cancel even within the first 5 minutes.

Otherwise, I would have given it a negative. This was my worst flying experience and my children's first flying experience. We were supposed to fly out Sunday morning at 7.45 am and due to a mechanical issue the flight was delayed (at first) and ended up getting cancelled. The next flight out was full, so we had to take the next available flight at 4.45. Spent all day at the airport waiting to start our Orlando vacation. I was thinking this would be the worst part of our trip - but it wasn't. On the way home - our flight was delayed yet again. We flew out 2 hours after our original flight was scheduled, which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Chicago. There were no later flights, so we had to stay overnight. When I asked them about a room, along with many other passengers, we were given a discounted rate at a hotel 15 miles from the airport. The discounted rate was $75 and they didn't offer to pay for a cab (the shuttle wasn't running this late). Rather than taking the room, we slept at the airport.

Tickets are expensive and additional charges are applied for a second suitcase, if you want to choose a seat and $9 for an alcoholic spirit! The food was nothing short of disgusting. Many passenger bought their own packed lunches. The IFE was like something out of the 70's. Overhead monitors with no choice of movie.

This time, my flight left an hour late because of AC issues. When we land in Dallas for my transfer, I went from a 45 minute layover, to run as fast as I could to catch my gate.

Our plane to Heathrow was late and we missed our transfer, so when we got off our plane at Heathrow an American employee gave us new transfer tickets and told us to hurry to our next gate to catch it. So we ran to the next gate which took 30 minutes (Heathrow). When we got there my wife looked at the tickets and the layover was 4 hours. So why did the employee have us run? Because the flight was to Florence, not Pisa and they probably didn't want us to notice. So we went back through security (1.5 hours, Heathrow) and we got new tickets through American through British Airways to Pisa. We had about an hour wait after another run through security (1.5 hours) and back to the proper gate. So why didn't American put us on this flight in the first place? They work with British Airways to get customers to Pisa! Since we got back I contacted American about this issue, they sent us a voucher for $200 for a luggage mess up on the way home.

The flight to Washington arrives to DCA on time, I had enough time to board my flight to Miami, where I boarded without any problems but once again faced rude flight attendants. Arrive in Miami 20 minutes delayed where I was called up to the counter by an agent where I was asked to switch seats with another passenger because a family was traveling. I paid extra for this seat because all that was left was the preferred seating, I asked the agent if I would be moved to a preferred seat, she said yes. I get in line to board and am told rudely that I was in boarding group 4 and that they were only boarding group 1 at the moment. I paid extra to be in boarding group 1 and will never again switch seats with someone. Finally am able to board and the safety video plays on the screen on the backs of the seats. The pilot comes over saying that there are two minor problems that need to be taken care of before we can take off. After waiting for over an hour the pilot comes back over the intercom again to explain that we need to deplane. So we got off the plane and wait at the gate for another hour before we are finally told that the flight won't leave until 11.30 the next morning.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Beth Kutcher,United States,7/25/2015,"American is usually okay for me but they aggravated me this time around. I'm assuming the airlines set the flight times. We had a 2 hour layover which is usually enough time but due to the size and unecessary complexity  I already reviewed the airport separately) of Miami airport, it was not enough time and we had to run to make final boarding call. I feel like an airline should understand times and how each airport is and should not schedule flights if they know it will be almost impossible for their customers. We were so close to not making it even though we were responsible with booking the layover times. If there is such a risk of passengers not making it don't schedule flights for those times! Part of the problem was the need to claim baggage and recheck it which we were not informed of when we booked the flights. It took far too long for our baggage to come and there was no one around to answer questions about whether or not more baggage was coming. Then after running to make it we still didn't take off on time. We sat for 30 mins at the gate while they fixed some problem in cargo. Some smaller complaints: they did not serve snacks on any of their flights for this trip and they did not show any good entertainment.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,William Gustin,United States,7/17/2015,"Flight from Boston to O'Hare, fair to good. Basic experience. AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation. Yes, the rain did cause part of the delay, but really no responsibility was attributed to the airline for the other factors that weighed into the cancellation.

To start, the boarding began 20 minutes late because a previous American Airlines flight to Seattle was delayed. CDG is a shocking airport. I wasn't looking forward to the old B767 that we would fly either. But flight took off on time and wasn't that bad. I slept most of the time, partly due to a lack of personal entertainment. The only entertainment was an overhead screen showing some terrible movie. Crew was good, particularly one. Can't remember his name but you'll know when you meet him. Food was okay, main meal was decent, the ice-cream and snacks were excellent. Flight landed on time.

We did not leave the airport until after midnight. Nobody was offered an explanation as to why we were delayed. We had not one, but 3 gate changes, and our party was traveling with someone who needed assistance. The airport in Miami is huge and after the last gate change, we were told that our flight would leave in 30 min. The AA agent made one phone call for assistance and then left us to our own devices. We had to frantically scramble to find a golf cart, wheelchair, someone to assist. Many of the other passengers on the flight were outraged and not one AA representative gave us any reason why our flight kept getting postponed. Finally, when we boarded at 11.30, the pilot explained that extreme weather kept us from leaving on time. Not sure if I buy this explanation, as other flights departed, but at least he offered an explanation and an apology. Not even a packet of peanuts.

Directed to counters to deal with and maybe try and book next flight. No apology, staff were unhelpful and counter staff downright ""offish"" to the situation. I was even told the mobile app doesn't communicate with flight counter so its information can be incorrect. So the question is what's the point of the app if doesn't provide up-to-date info. Flight booked for next day. So we incurred cost of overnight near JFK and incurred cost of night at destination. No offer to assist with accommodation for overnight caused by the cancellation.

We bought tickets a month before our flight and ended up paying almost $700 each roundtrip (for 4 of us). On June 21st we drove 2 hours to Charlotte Airport and on our way we got an automated call telling us our flight had been cancelled for maintenance (at around 11.30) on a beautiful, clear day. Not knowing what to do we continued to the airport terminal and through the check-in line. The employee at the check-in said we had been rescheduled on a flight for the next day at 5.30am. This wasn't an acceptable alternative for us so we were put on standby for a 4.30 flight but then we had to check-in our stowaway luggage. We asked how we would get our luggage back if we didn't make it on the 4.30 flight, and were told that the luggage was marked for standby and would not be put on the plane without us. Past security we checked with other United Airways employees who assured us this was the case. These employees were all helpful and patient with us. We waited in the airport for hours for the standby flight, which unsurprisingly did not have space for all 4 of us. We were sent to baggage claim and waited for luggage that never showed up. Our bags had been sent to Toronto YYZ without us. I called Toronto Pearson airport where a helpful woman connected me to the United Airways baggage office. Finally I was satisfied that they probably weren't going to send our luggage back to Charlotte, and we drove up north. At Toronto Pearsons we found customer service who made a call and told us exactly where to find our luggage. A 1/10 rating is generous.",,FamilyLeisure,Economy,CTL to YYZ,1,1,1,,,1,,1,0

The flight time continued to change and hours passed by with little communication as to why. The flight that was suppose to board at 9.40pm did not get cancelled until just before 2am. I had already been traveling for 14 hours. I waited in a ridiculously long line only to be told that the hotels in the area were all booked and that the cots at the airport were taken. I did not sleep at all. I had to re-route my original flight from LAX twice because one of the workers routed me to San Jose which was 6 hours away from my destination (LAX). They re-routed me again an hour out of the way at John Wayne airport and had to find someone else to pick me up because of the change of my arrival.

Several of us were late by minutes to connecting flights to Europe, after being encouraged to run to catch our connections, all flights left without the 15-20 of us. These things sometimes happen, but what followed was not acceptable. Customer service representatives had no solutions for anyone, other than bookings for the next flight 24 hours later. No hotel, transportation, nothing. My service at the desk was dismissive: we can't help. We have no solutions or contingencies. It was only after my pestering them, when she handed me the dreaded ""pink slip"" - a generic phone number and website for ""discount"" on a hotel. The biggest problem is that customer service failed spectacularly at the point where the client is most vulnerable and alone-in transit. There should be a representative for each imperiled connecting flight, or group of flights. On-ground coordinators should be communicating with gate agents and in-flight attendants. Even when connections are simply impossible, let us know and give us options, at the point of debarkation. All it takes is for someone to actively monitor and question the line.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Matthew Butler,United States,6/17/2015,"Throughout my recent trip, there were difficulties due to under-staffing at the terminals and ticket check-in, leading to several long delays. Several of us missed our first flight out of Gainesville since there was miscommunication leading to no one being at the check-out counter prior to our departure and none of the boarding pass kiosks working. The return flights were equally difficult, with only 1 kiosk working and only one person working the ticket counter, which lead to check-in requiring about an hour. Several of the initial flights were delayed, leading to several of us missing our connection. While this is understandable and does occur at times, it took approximately 2 hours to receive our hotel vouchers even though the flight arrangements were made prior. This was again due to being under-staffed as only 1 person was working this terminal. The following day, multiple flights were cancelled due to ""mechanical difficulties"" leading several of us to again miss our flights. This again lead to an almost 2 hour wait in order to re-book after already waiting an hour prior to the flight being cancelled, causing many of us to miss our chance at making a compatible connection flight. I was initially told I would again have to stay over-night and was not given further options. After calling customer service myself, I found a flight to an airport 2.5 hours away although I was required to pay the rental car fee to drive back home. In summary, due to consistent under-staffing, there were numerous long waits which ultimately delayed travel planned. This combined with several flight delays (due to mechanical difficulties - not weather), lead do my initial flight leaving a day late and my return flight being delayed 2 additional days.

Virtually identical to the CX layout, which I love. Quite a bit of privacy and personal space, with a very comfortable flat bed. IFE had ample choices, and the food and beverage was good as well. In flight overseas WiFi worked very well also. Flagship check in at LHR in a separate and dedicated building makes the process very easy.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,J Rose,United States,6/15/2015,"First overseas trip in the newly configured B767 with flat beds. The cabin looks very crisp, clean, and modern but I found the seats to be uncomfortable and poorly designed. The seats seem very narrow, and once in the flat bed position your feet end up in a narrow, confining box-like area which makes it difficult to move around. Impacted sleep quality immensely. Tablet-based IFE strange, clunky with limited choices. The biggest positive surprise was the food, which was as good an airline meal as I've had. Perfectly roasted duck breast in a coconut lime curry was restaurant quality, salads fresh and crisp. On balance better than expected and an improvement for AA.",B767,Business,Business Class,JFK to CDG,7,2,3,5,2,3,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Jennifer Luong,United States,6/14/2015,"AA has completely lost my trust. The woman at the check in counter knew nothing about free bags for military civilians. After paying for our bag, she gave us our boarding pass and mentioned nothing about it being delayed. We found out after I noticed that the time was different on our boarding pass. When the time came to board, we find out that the flight is cancelled when we noticed no plane at our gate. We approached some AA attendants and the woman apologized for forgetting to announce it, and then looked for another flight for us. She found one for a 5am flight - 4.30am check in and gave us a hotel voucher of which the shuttle runs every half hour. That means we would have to leave the hotel at 3am in order to make the flight. At 2.30am, my boyfriend finds out through the flight tracker to discover it is cancelled again! He tries to call customer service to reschedule but had a 1 hour wait time on the phone. When he finally gets through, the man on the phone suggested a flight at JFK at 7am, which we wouldn't be able to make it in time even if we left at that moment (3.40) because we would have to wait for the (every 30 min) shuttle, get on the airport train, get to the stop for long term parking, then get the bus to get us to our car, and then drive over an hour to JFK. So then he puts us on a 3.50 flight to Chicago getting us there at nearly 6pm. Our whole Saturday is gone. AA wasted us a lot of money and time. I will never fly with them again.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Sheila Warmisham,United Kingdom,6/13/2015,"What has happened? Airlines have revolved into greedy money making machines and in turn allowed people to become smug and uncaring for others. What used to happen in my day when a person of 6ft 5ins boarded a plane there was consideration and care? Now it is all about extra money! I distinctly remember when this situation arose we would kindly ask smaller exit seated passengers to swap and 9 times out of ten people would be happy to do so. We maybe would offer a few drinks in return and everyone was happy. My son who is 6ft 5in was like a caged animal on our recent American Airlines flight, 10 hours of absolute hell. Yes we could have paid more for an exit seat but he is a student and this was not an option. While shorter passengers get seats for less he is now faced with either having to pay more to travel than shorter people or not travel at all. It is not as if he can do anything about his height, if he was simply overweight – then he could diet – but this is not the case. American Airlines allowed him to stand up all the way from LA to LHR for 10 hours, when he had to sit his legs had to be wide apart and any chance of a brace position would be completely ruled out. American Airlines – shame on you for your greed! I am not sure why trolleys were used for the meal service – they could have just chucked boxes of junk down the cabin and asked those interested to catch them.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,S Tuft,United States,6/13/2015,"I flew non-stop from SLC to MIA on a redeye, 4 hours of flight time, no problems, delighted to find a non-stop flight. A week later, coming home, (June 10 2015) was a totally different experience.  The flight to DFW was delayed for a mechanical problem (air speed indicator), so they re-boarded us on a different plane, but after all
passengers were seated and the safety video shown, they said there was another mechanical problem (didn't identify it) and sent all 200 of us to a re-booking desk which couldn't possibly accommodate all of us.  Meanwhile after an hour standing in line, they called us back to the second airplane and the ones of us who hadn't left in search of another flight, toted rolling bags etc on board yet a third time and we sat and continued to wait while the baggage was loaded. This leg of the trip had begun with the supposed 12.25 pm departure of Flight 2407, but by now it was 5.30 pm, with no signs of hope. I knew I'd already missed my connecting flight to SLC, and was able to book another DFW flight for 6 pm.  I made it in time to board this different flight, but the 6.00 departure time turned out to be 7.00pm.  The delay here was for yet another unexplained reason.  Still,  I was able at DFW to make my connecting flight to SLC on a 10.00 flight, but this interminable day stretched out far longer than it should have, and I don't see how it could be, that every single AA flight I was on that day, all had delays.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,G Walker,United States,6/6/2015,American Airlines without notification or reason cancelled my ticket on the return leg of my trip leaving me stranded. The flight to Seattle from Philadelphia went smoothly. I was able to check in board and fly without problem and it was actually one of my most pleasant flights. However when I tried to check in for the return flight I was informed that my ticket had been cancelled. After waiting on hold for a long time one of the American Airlines representatives informed me that the ticket was cancelled because I never boarded the plane in Philadelphia. Eventually I was told that if I showed my boarding pass from the flight from Philadelphia to Seattle to a check-in representative they would be able to book a seat on the flight for me. However until that time the seat was not reserved for me or guaranteed in any way. It was important that I make the flight in order to be at work so I had to make an extra trip to the airport early so I could re-book my ticket thereby wasting precious vacation time. So do not fly on American Airlines unless you enjoy the thrill of not knowing if you'll get to use the ticket you bought the mystery of whether the airline knows you're on the plane or not and the excitement of using vacation time to pick your way through a companies complex inaccessible and unable customer service system.,,,Economy,,,5,1,4,0,,,1,0

Although the flight was delayed almost two hours due to a combination of weather aircraft delays etc.. the flight was fine. The JFK ground crew worked with a combination of humor and professionalism that provided the right touch at the gate and once the aircraft arrived everyone worked very quickly to get us on our way.

I was lucky to get the seats with more space without paying as I was one of the last ones to check in. The airplane was so old that it is difficult to put a small bag inside the plane. What's more shocking is not having an individual screen for each passenger. moreover on the Paris-Miami flight the steward was not nice at all. While the hostess gave me a can of coke he only gave me a glass. The food was ok but very low quality compared to the price paid. On the return flight the food was just terrible no comment I did not eat it. Of course same thing on the return flight no screens and very old plane. The seat in front of me was all torn.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,K Vasudha,United States,5/31/2015,"A very frustrating experience. First their flight is delayed due to ""bad weather"" in LGA whereas we can see that United and all other airlines are taking off and the weather looked good enough. Initially they said it is delayed by an hour so we thought fine lets wait for an hour then they tell its delayed by another 2 hours. We had to catch a connecting flight at ORD which had just an hour layover. Then finally this flight from LGA is scheduled to take off 6 hours later than actual scheduled timings which means the connecting flight has already left. I called the customer care to check for the status and they tell that there are no more connecting flights from ORD to XNA for the day. The next connecting flight was only at 9.15am from ORD. So we decided to wait until 6.30am that day and leave directly from LGA instead of going to ORD and waiting till 9.15am. We (including my aged mother) finally landed up sleeping in the airport all night. The TSA officials were kind enough to give all passengers sleeping in the airport a cot and a bed sheet. Next day morning we start at 6.15AM and then again the flight is delayed by 2 hrs.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,G Mulcahy,United States,5/28/2015,All four flights were terrible and the disorganization and poor customer service was inexcusable. We didn't experience anything like mixed up flights or delays that lasted too long but what we did experience was bad enough. We left for an international flight that departed at 6am they had such slow kiosk and desk service that almost an entire flight of people barely made it on the plane. Kiosks weren't working the people that worked there didn't even know what was going on and were flustered. The anxiety level was high because we all thought we might miss our flight due to American Airlines awful check in service. Instead of reassuring people that the flight wasn't going to leave without 75% of it's passengers. The wifi isn't free it doesn't work half the time and they boast 'free' things to watch and it's all a scam. For as much as they charge for a flight something as little as wifi can make a huge difference. We were on an international flight and they don't even offer snacks you have to buy snacks! I had a bad cold coming home and asked the flight attendant for some cold water and hot water and tea. She rolled her eyes at me and brought me hot water and cold water and no tea. I had to ask for tea from another flight attendant who practically threw it at me. I went to the bathroom during the flight and asked a flight attendant for tissues (again I had a bad cold) she was sitting down looking at her phone and didn't even look up at me just pointed at the bathroom. On the flight home there was a group of people that were obviously traveling together and were so disruptive and rude. They were standing up in the aisle talking loudly and there was a toddler with them that kept running up and down the aisle.

It was by far one of my worst experiences in commercial flying. The reasoning for this rating is extensive and ranges from their computer changing my times and seats three times from reservation to flight to inoperative bathroom in flight to massive delays both ways ranging from almost 2 hours to cool down an aircraft cabin before boarding to waiting over 2 hours for flight attendants to arrive in Miami from Philadelphia. It is obvious that no longer is the passenger important but rather all the extra charges and cramped seating that rule the day.

Both flights fine with slightly early arrivals and no drama - Obviously older planes showing some wear and tear but comfortable with standard First class seats. FA tending to First Class on the ORD-SAT leg was excellent hard working attentive continuously present in the cabin to tend to the passengers also a bit more formal (in a good way) less chatty (again good) and obviously concentrating on delivering a good service. FA on the second leg more relaxed in delivering service but still ok. Catering for the first (evening) leg was a chicken or pasta choice with the chicken dish bland and just barely edible. Not good enough even for economy on many other airlines. Also strange that AA considers the chicken or pasta choice a First Class offering on a three hour dinner time flight probably only possible on the US market. Wines served were ok and regular refills offered by the good FA. First Class breakfast RNO-ORD leg was cereal with no other option. Again how this can be considered a First Class breakfast for a four hour flight is beyond me. Good premium check-in with no significant lines and manned counters in both ORD and RNO boarding professional and painless. Actually two pleasant flights with good crews but also with sub- par catering. Also of course excellent value due to the upgrade.,,,First Class,,7,5,5,2,1,,,5,1

We were then diverted due to weather - admittedly the crew were helpful during our enforced 4 hour plane-bound ground stop in Austin. We finally got to Dallas 5 hours late – ‘to be greeted by a (non-existent) customer representative’ the queue for the customer service at C25 was pathetic – two people and a queue of several hundred snaking around the terminal. Fortunately I had my BA executive card and got into the Admirals lounge were the queue was only about 20 people. We (three of us) were rebooked on the flight to Narita (Japan) and onto Seoul the following day. Although technically that flight would have left technical ‘issues’ meant that we left 7.5 hours late arriving in Narita at about 11pm. What a contrast - upon arrival there were about 15 Japanese customer service people with individual ‘packages’ for passengers containing onward boarding passes details of buses to pre-arranged hotel accommodation and a food box. Next day a special bus took us back to the airport for our onward flight to Seoul. Our luggage was not so lucky – even with the 7 hour delay at Dallas AA was unable to send our luggage out for another 2 days! The return flight was ‘better’ – in that there wasn't a delay but the flight was cramped – the 777 clearly had not been ‘spring cleaned’ since its delivery many many years ago the food was mediocre at best and the ‘entertainment system’ simply because it was entertaining trying to find anything of interest to watch/listen to.

Water-cannon send-off from Terminal D - then a nice smooth take-off with cheers from passengers. Good inflight entertainment - but still they show the same shows that were on flights I took 9 months ago. Why can't American keep updated entertainment? Emirates/Singapore/Qantas/British all do it.

We've traveled to over 70 countries world wide and this was the first and last time we'll ever use American Airlines. They use a 777-200 out of Chicago which resembles a cattle car the way passengers are packed into the economy section. 2-5-2 configuration and while we paid extra to sit in the two side the seats were so cramped there wasn't enough room between rows to put the tray table down for meals. When the passengers in front reclined their seats it was claustrophobic. Keep in mind this is a 14 hour flight. Ironically enough the flight attendants who refer to this equipment as the Slave Ship told us AA is talking about adding another row of seats. Meals were horrid power port and audio jacks didn't work and the ""entertainment"" system is laughable.

The Staff were quite rude to all passengers. One fellow passenger asked what choice was for breakfast? ""Only one option"" was the reply ""take it or leave it""! We got the impression that they didn't really want to be there. Many reading lights and video screens were not working just what you need on an overnight transatlantic trip! We bought our tickets in September 2014 and we couldn't get seats together when it came to the 24 hr check-in. So what gives. I will say this now; we wont fly AA again and I will not recommend them either. They are advertising ""We are Adding new planes every week"" I think they should repair some of their existing ones first!",,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,3,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,P Pomeranze,United States,5/2/2015,Very happy to write a quick follow up to my recent review indicating that my good experience was not a fluke.

Really happy with the service the stewards were very helpful even giving us info on the best places to eat in New York. The flight was half empty so we could spread out on both flights. It was on time. Food ok and they make sure we had a drink in our hand whenever we wanted. Very comprehensive choice of old and new films/TV. Would recommend.,,,Economy,,8,4,5,4,5,,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Peter Pomeranze,United States,4/30/2015,I am quite happy to write a positive review of my experience yesterday. Flying from Honolulu to LA on a 757 I was expecting very little. Instead I was welcomed by a warm crew to a comfortable seat and received warm attentive service. The breakfast was quite nice and beverages were free flowing and offered in a friendly manner. The entertainment on a screen ahead was minimal and that was the only second rate part of the trip. The pillow and blanket offered were large and comfy. I hope this signals an upgrade system-wide for a product that has long called for one.,,,First Class,,8,4,5,5,2,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Eric Allen,United States,4/28/2015,"Will not be flying with this airline again. Was traveling from Seattle to Houston Hobby through DFW. Plane was delayed on the runway for over an hour because American couldn't communicate with their own computer system in Dallas. Because of the delay we landed in DFW just 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to leave in another terminal. Hauled over to that terminal only to see a completely different flight posted at my gate with no agents in site. Found another gate with an agent and told him my situation. He put me on standby for another flight to Houston. I was called from the standby list and put on that flight they asked me to gate check my bag. Then after I was seated they called me off the airplane saying they had double booked my seat! They could not return my bag to me. Put me on yet another flight to Houston for two hours later. But that gate listed information for another flight. Talking with other customers it became clear that none of the gates displayed the appropriate flights it was utter chaos with agents switching gates for flights every 15 minutes or so and disgruntled passengers everywhere. Meanwhile it turns out that the flight they kicked me off of was cancelled because the pilot had reached his maximum number of hours before the flight ever left. Everyone on that flight was moved to my new flight. Eventually they boarded the flight and then sat at the gate for an hour because as the captain put it ""someone who needs to be on the flight is not on it."" The passenger sitting next to me showed me radar on her phone indicating that a storm was rolling in that would prevent us from leaving if we didn't leave soon. Many passengers started shouting to the crew asking why we hadn't left yet and many openly started wondering if the crew was actually making excuses to delay the flight until it was cancelled. Remember that many of these passengers had been on a cancelled flight just a few hours before. Anyway the captain did wait long enough that a storm rolled in as predicted. We were told we would need to fly out of the other side of the airport and circle around the storm so we taxied over. Once we were all the way on the other end we were told the new route required more fuel than we had so we had to return to the gate. Then we were told the ramp was closed so there was no gate for us to refuel at so we had to just wait. Finally a gate opened up for us but we just sat there for another hour. Then the captain told us that he reached his maximum number of flying hours so the flight was cancelled. At this point I cut my losses rented a car and drove to Houston from Dallas.",,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,C Nguyen,United States,4/28/2015,This review is being written after a number of times flying with American Airlines. You can almost always expect delays terrible customer service and just an overall bad experience. We had a two hour delay from MIA to SFO which would connect to LAX. The airline representatives were not helpful and made our travel anxiety even worse. Absolutely the worst airline across the board-from aircraft to personnel. How could the customer service be so terrible? The only reason I chose this airline was because it was cheaper than JetBlue. American Airlines is truly a disappointment.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

No apologies and stupid explanations. Put us on flight over 5 hours later. Once boarded we sat over an hour waiting for a pilot! Two different stories. Pilot delayed in traffic or pilot was timed out for his duty day and had to find someone else to drive the 737. And of course they lost our luggage.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Sven Koller,Germany,4/27/2015,We had two flights with AA from Madrid to Miami with their 777. The first flight was five hours late no excuse no money. The B777 is one of the worst you can fly with - 2-5-2 seating but AA charges 100 Euro extra for the 2 seats-row. The seating is horrible no space in economy the in-flight entertainment is like 2002 with a small amount of films on re-run every 15 or 30 minutes (by the way my LCD did not work). The worst about AA is the staff - unfriendly tired and virtually throwing the trash food on your seat. Even for a US-carrier AA is under all poor standards. So - stay away. American is like Ryanair but not as cheap. Never again!,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,2,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,B Wijesinghe,United States,4/24/2015,DCA-DFW-SEA-DFW-IAD B737-800 Coach Class for all four segments 04/17 and 04/21. PROS: First Class check-in due to my One World Emerald Tier status; Flights on time except for DFW-SEA that left the gate on time but returned due to a mechanical problem that resulted in a delayed departure of an hour and arrival in SEA 40 minutes late. All planes clean and either new or fairly new. Staff efficient and most were quite friendly except for one on the SEA-DFW segment who had an attitude problem. Snacks for sale on three of the four segments and complimentary beverages served on all segments seats comfortable except for DCA-DFW (see CONS). Baggage transferred efficiently and delivered on the carousels at SEA and IAD very quickly as they had One World priority tags. CONS: The Admiral's Club Lounges look nice with comfortable seats but the free snack offerings at DFW were pitiful DCA-DFW had a brand new plane with the new B737 sky interior and AA leather seats. This was outstanding though sadly ruined by two awful boxes for the seat back video screens anchored on both sides of the middle seat foot well. This was pathetic for legroom on even a three-hour flight; Any airline that can find a very compact version of this video control box is a winner! Overall despite the many negative reviews that I have read recently about AA I was very satisfied with this trip and will definitely use them again. I didn't have high expectations for domestic AA service upon arrival at DCA on 04/17 but they actually did much better on the entire round-trip.,,,Economy,,8,3,4,3,2,,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,J Kingston,United Kingdom,4/24/2015,R/T SFO-JFK. Outbound in business return in F. I think AA is doing a very good job with its Airbus 321 transcons in the premium classes. The seats are excellent both in C and in F. Indeed both are horiz lie flats. IFE is superb. Lots of choices large HD screens and Bose noise cancelling headphones supplied. Service was good in both directions. The food was a 7 on a scale of 10. My main criticism was the lunch in F. It unfortunately conveyed a sense of cut backs. Lounges at both ends were top notch particularly the F lounge at JFK. That is not to say that SFO Admirals was bad. It is truly excellent just that the F lounge is better. Overall on these transcons AA has a quality product.,,,First Class,,8,5,5,4,5,,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Fred Davidson,United States,4/23/2015,"Wife and I booked a trip from Houston to see the son in West Palm Beach on 4/17/2015. Our flight was supposed to be one of the first that left that day so we were ate the airport very early. Check in was 4 am. Of all the flights in the entire airport ours was delayed 2 hours. Why? Because they said it did not get in till late the previous day. Well that delay messed up our connecting flight in Dallas-Fort Worth so the day got worse and our total day was extended 6-7 hours. I understand that there are times when issues cannot be avoided but the airline booking personnel just didn't seem to care. We paid extra for the priority seating but they just threw us in the pool of last place seating until we got in their face. They did give us a meal voucher good for one of the vendors in the airport but only when we had to demand it. The pilot explained that there are rules of mandatory rest between flights which we understand but that news was known the previous day so why did we not get notified? The connecting flight was also delayed due to maintenance of passenger seats. For our return flight home my wife and I were praying for no issues but American Airlines made sure that we would not go home happy. The flight from West Palm Beach to Dallas-Fort Worth was pretty routine in the air but flight was delayed leaving the airport due to some ""auxiliary power"" issue that maintenance had to remedy before take off. When we arrived in Dallas-Fort Worth the powered boarding shute needed maintenance's attention before we could exit the plane into the terminal so we had to wait for that fix. As luck would have it our connecting flight was delayed another 1.5 hours! I will definitely find another airline before I choose this one again.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,V Jones,United States,4/23/2015,I was scheduled to fly from DFW to HOU Flight 5770 departing DFW 3.10pm arriving in HOU. Instead they notified us that there was no plane. We didn't have a plane to board until 5.30pm and the plane didn't depart until 6.20pm that evening. Over a 3 hour delay due to not having an available plane. Before we took off the pilot notified us that due to weather they were going to have to take a more Western route and were not sure if they were going to have enough fuel. Instead of actually getting more fuel we took off anyway. 30 min into the flight they notified us that there was a line to land into HOU due to weather and that they didn't have enough fuel and needed to land in San Antonio. Not only did we not get into SA until 8pm but the crew notified us that they had flown too many hours. So even if we did get more fuel there was no crew to fly the plane. At this point we were stranded in San Antonio and the weather had become so bad in Houston there were no planes out. We were stranded. After 2 hrs waiting in line the representative informed me I could not get back to Hobby until 7.30pm Monday. Monday I flew back to DFW 1433 to catch another plane 1489 to get to IAH by 12 noon. I took a cab from IAH to Hobby where my car was at b/c this was a better option than waiting all day to get back home. Practically over 24 hours to fly from DFW to HOU. I am extremely dissatisfied with American that I will no longer be flying this airline.

Seats were cramped. Snacks were to expensive. I checked my small bag to avoid the storage bin struggle.

The airplane was old. We could see where the paint was chipped on the right wing. We had seats 15D 15E and 15F. The seat next to the window would not move back up after it was inclined back. We were landing and we pressed the button and could not get the seat to move back in an upright position. A male flight attention called my attention and I said I could not move it. He said that seats on American were more aesthetic than they are functional. The airplane lacked tray tables. Accordingly when served drinks there was no place to put the drinks. Furthermore not only were tray tables absent from this old plane but even the lock to hold them in place was gone from the plane. The plane had not been properly cleaned before the flight and our flight was overbooked. The seats were very narrow even though we paid for more better seats. My mother who is of normal weight and body proportions had difficulty getting in and out of it.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Steve Bryant,United States,4/20/2015,"This is a rough review because we flew first business and coach. We usually fly coach but for a trip to Napa we used our points to go first class. The AA/United merger combined the worst two airlines in the Western world. Flew on 4/7 (260 / 193) - BAN-DFX-SAN. Service food seating excellent. Plane a little old and shaky but all in all a good flight. Returned 4/13 (193/5290) SAN-Charlotte-BNA. Although we had first class we were relegated to business with an accompanying drop in quality across the board. The trouble is the age of the planes - it's like something from a museum. The noise from the engine was so loud it was like sticking your head under the hood of a car. But for once all flights left on time without mechanical problems. We were closer to the real world of 95% of all travelers with tasteless food (a box handed out at the end of a 6 hour flight with a roll candy bar and smoothy). Entertainment (quote unquote) was from attached dirty ancient screens for which AA would kindly sell earphones. I had my IPAD and kept busy while the Mrs tried to doze. Then at Charlotte it's Reality Time. We got bumped to economy (first row) but the constant groans reminded us that these ""seats"" were once used for unruly reform school students. That was in the 1940's since they were tiny dirty torn and stretched. The place looked filthy. A webbed shower curtain in several pieces separated ""first class"" (real classy) but they did manage to pass drinks to us in the cattle car.

I had to rush and take ground transportation from Sacramento to San Francisco and working out the next step as I was moving ahead. Forget help no guidance was provided on how I can get to SF airport.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Bruce Kanin,United States,4/19/2015,"On April 9 2015 while my wife and I waited to board a flight from Barcelona to NY-JFK there was an announcement that it had been canceled. It was hard to hear and broadcast only once. Several of us had to confirm with an attendant that it was indeed canceled that we had to pick up our luggage at the baggage area and return to the check-in counter. My wife and I along with the others scrambled to navigate our way through the airport area finally to the baggage area. After what seemed like a very long wait our luggage along with a handful of others' came out last. This meant that when we finally found our way back to the AA check-in area we were at the end of an extremely long line. Eventually my wife and I ""split"" with her waiting on a long line at an AA service counter. After about 3 hours she made it to the front while I still had many people ahead of me. AA booked us on Iberia flights for the following day and a hotel with paid meals. We were then given directions to a free hotel shuttle. We never found it and ended up paying for a taxi but the driver took us to the ""wrong"" airport hotel. Fortunately that hotel let us take their shuttle to the ""right"" hotel. It's surprising but almost understandable that AA had no ""backup airplane"". My complaint is less about the cancellation and more about the lack of assistance at Barcelona Airport. Announcements and guidance was poor. There was no one to help us navigate back to the baggage area. We had to wait on a customs line to get back ""in"" so that we could go to the baggage area. We and others had to grab AA personnel passing by to find out anything even in the baggage area. It was an upsetting experience that cost us a day.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,N Hammond,United Kingdom,4/17/2015,My husband and our teenage son went to visit family in Nashville for two weeks this Easter. We booked our four flights each London-Chicago-Nashville and back through BA. BA were supposed to take us as far as Chicago with American Airlines doing the Chicago to Nashville bit. We missed our connection at both legs of the journey which was hugely inconvenient particularly when returning to the UK. To be fair AA brought us back to Chicago airport in time but for some reason the they were not given a gate for more than an hour. I approached the flight attendant asking whether AA can communicate with BA about this delay particularly as there were several people apart from us who were due to catch the same flight. She said that the flight will probably wait for us they know that we are being delayed. This resulted in a mad run between terminals 3 and 5 in vain. We were then sent back to AA desk in Terminal 3 to rebook our tickets for another flight. AA staff took a very long time to process each person. By the time we finished it was more than 1.5 hrs after we started queuing. We were told that the we will be put on AA flight to London tomorrow afternoon. There are many flights between London and Chicago and we requested an earlier flight. The person dealing with us said that if we wanted tickets to an earlier flight we should have come earlier. She refused to check whether BA had any flights the next day. In fact they were as unhelpful as possible. I made a point that we paid tickets for the flight that just left and had we managed to be on it we would not be asking for anything. We were told that we cannot collect our luggage as 'it has gone to BA'. We were given vouchers for an airport hotel and forced to stay overnight without luggage and they reluctantly gave us two sets of very basic things such as toothbrush and toothpaste for us three. The next day at AA check in desk we were told we need to collect our luggage at luggage collection No 5 after which we needed to bring it back upstairs and check them in. They could not locate our luggage. As the time for our next flight was approaching my husband ran to the check in desk to let them know that our luggage never materialised whilst I waited at carrousel No 5 in case it does. We asked if we could be upgraded if there were any spare seats in the premier class and the staff member said 'we do not upgrade for such a reason'.

I booked this route especially to take this newer plane for the inflight entertainment which did not disappoint. I found the crew okay and some even smiled! What I disliked about AA was the exorbitant prices they charge for pre-allocated seats which was a necessity in order to seat a family of 4 together. The food was mostly below average but having read reviews I wasn't surprised. I don't like the way they have chosen to add another seat to each row in economy. So instead of 9 abreast they have made it 10. This makes the aisle ridiculously narrow and I don't see how hundreds of people would be able to escape in an emergency so I'm surprised the FAA permits this higher density seating. Legroom was tight for anyone of above average height. I also found it strange how the seat belt sign was illuminated for virtually the whole flight - in both directions - and there are hardly any announcements from the flight deck even when turbulence is quite choppy. I chose AA for the equipment they use on this route but I would think twice about booking them again due to the hidden costs that aren't factored into the ticket price.,,,Economy,,5,2,3,2,4,,,1,0

We knew it was a 777-300ER LHR-MIA and a 777-300 back. The outbound was fantastic with great service seats AVOD and everything one should expect from a modern BC cabin. we have flown Emirates BC 4 times in the past 6 months and this cabin is comparable to both the A380 and the 777 in that class defining airline. Whilst we found the service in Emirates a bit disorganised AA was efficient friendly and warm we like the more mature no nonsense crew on Airlines out of the States although it's a thin line to rude and dis-interested on occasions! However AA should be ashamed scheduling a 200 version for the return leg which was not a result of a last minute 'change out' due to failure but that quote ' The newer plane has been stolen for Los Angeles some weeks ago'. Call me sad but I would have changed my flight if I'd known we'd be on this antique! Lie at an angle beds a 10 inch screen maybe 11 low def (love the jumpy fuzzy effects reminded me of the 90s) and the general feel of a very tired plane! What was different was the excellent service and food I was annoyed when I sat down but slept for 3 hours and was relaxed when I got off. AA has begun to catch up it's got some way to go and given the lounge experience (don't ever ever call sparkling wine Champagne!) there is a way to go the crew are spot on and at the end of the day that's what makes a flight. Seat score is for the 777-300ER but oddly it's not great for couples as these seats are very.

No one instructed us to do anything I went to other agents and they just told us they could not help. Just ridiculous all around meanwhile Mother's and children traveling alone sitting at the gate crying trying to figure out how they were going to get home. I ended up having to get a rental to make it to my final destination on my own. All American Airlines does is inconvenience people the final straw was when the agents at the rental car counter stated that American does this every week to folks who are going to Houston Austin and Lufkin so it was nothing new to them they claim mechanical failure! If they supposedly have new planes and they are investing in all this new equipment where is it? Why don't they use some of those new so called planes they have purchased! This was a less than an hour flight come on American have some common sense!,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,I Yang,United States,4/3/2015,From LAX to PVG (Shanghai) the worst business class. Most of the flights to Asia have much better business seating. The middle row has three seats if you are in the middle of the middle row you must cross someone to get in and out. The seats configuration is old and looks very dark and unpleasant.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Andrew Ashton,United Kingdom,4/3/2015,AA are making a big thing about all the new planes they are buying. I flew from Heathrow to JFK 27th March on a really smart 777. That's where the complements end though. I have never flown with a worse cabin crew. They all wore different clothing as though they had turned up from home and not bothered to change. They were totally uncommunicative - amazingly not a word was spoken to us through the entire journey. One of the crew fell asleep in a seat at the back of the cabin. Food was served as though they were doing us a favour and just dropped in front of us without a word there was not a friendly smile between them. One of the crew was not tall enough to close the overhead lockers. I cannot believe AA are spending so much on renewing their fleet yet seem totally unconcerned that their staff are behaving in this way. I flew back on BA - a fabulous crew who worked their socks off for the customers what a contrast!,,,Economy,,3,2,1,2,4,,,2,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Eric Poole,United States,4/1/2015,AA flight 397 on March 25th. The first leg of our trip was delayed so we arrived at the gate 7 minutes before the flight was to take off. We had notified the gate agents that we were on the way to the flight but they shut the door in our face and would not let us board. We found out they had overbooked the flight by 50 seats. On the next flight we watched as friends of the gate agents boarded on standby while the rest of us were bumped > again. No gate agents seemed interested in helping us get home. We eventually had to rent a car and drive home since American Airlines would not give us a seat on any flight to get home. An extra $100 and 10 hours delayed we arrived home.,,,Economy,,3,3,2,3,2,,,2,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M J Downey,United Kingdom,3/29/2015,LHR to MIA Business Class. The plane was one of the older 777-200 with 2-3-2 seating meaning that the person in the middle always had to disturb someone to get out. The seat was ok but not really a true flat bed. The VOD was patchy in that on two of the films I watched there was something wrong with the display so I had to stop it and restart it. The food was very nice - my steak was delicious. Cabin crew were all very friendly and accommodating.,,,Business Class,,6,3,5,5,3,,,4,0

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,G Chaplin,United Kingdom,3/28/2015,I flew Manchester to JFK and return with AA. On arrival at Manchester the airline staff quizzed us in detail about where else we usually travelled to why we were going to the States what jobs we did. This took about 10 minutes. Check in was via a machine designed to make AA a staff saving however it did nothing for their customers most of whom were frustrated at its inability to work. The whole crew were late and ran through the airport together to take up their posts. Did this account for them not checking whether the passengers had on their seat belts or arm rests in the correct position? Apparently not as it was exactly the same on the return flight. The safety video could not be viewed by passengers seated by the window due to the low overhead and central hanging videos. Did the crew have a uniform? They all dressed differently some wore extensive amounts of jewellery and chewed gum others had not even combed or tidied their hair. All were markedly scruffy compared to every other airline I have ever flown with. More worrying was that none of the crew advised passengers to remain seated when the seat belt light was lit and passengers proceeded to walk around the cabin throughout the flight. Or maybe it was the Captain's error in not turning the light off at all. Who knows whether we even had a Captain as on the out flight no announcements were even made! Not impressive on safety at all. Lets face it food comfort etc are also important but if an airline fails on basic safety the rest pales to insignificance.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,2,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Kay Molen,United States,3/25/2015,I have the time to write this review due to the third delay I've had with this airline. Not a single good thing I can say about my experience with American. I have flown Southwest Delta Jetblue Frontier and this is by far the worst airline I have flown. We had an hour and a half delay the first flight plus an emergency situation so we missed our connecting flight which has never happened to me. They supplied us with the worst hotel overnight. It wasn't just us that missed our flight 5 other families on separate ones missed theirs too. Then the flight the next day got delayed 30 minutes! So our three day trip turned into one day from all the delays and missed flights. Finally heading home and they announce mechanical problems with the plane. So now the flight is delayed 2 hours and we are missing our connecting flight to Salt Lake. So we get to board on a 6 pm flight but let's not kid ourselves that'll be delayed too so probably 7. And then it's a 4.5 hour flight so I'll be getting home at 2am. Other airlines can figure it out so please do to and spare us all the pain and frustration.,,,Economy,,1,2,1,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,B Robinson,United States,3/23/2015,"Due to a booking snafu (which may have been of my making) and the flight being oversold our non-stop return flight LHR-RDU was unavailable. The courteous and helpful ticket desk staff re-booked our free ticket LHR-JFK-RDU. We were told with great pride that the transatlantic portion would be aboard AA's new flagship 777-300ER. I applaud AA as being the only U.S. airline to give it's customers the opportunity to ride the latest and finest of American ingenuity technology and manufacturing excellence. It did strike me however that AA may have commissioned a ""lite"" version of the plane as it was missing some of the bells and whistles I had seen on some foreign carriers (wood floors mood lighting etc). Overall the economy interior can best be described as bland. On the plus side mammoth overhead bins decent seats great ride and as good an in flight entertainment system as you'll find anywhere in coach. Watched three excellent first run movies. All we need now is some edible food and AA will have caught up with BA and VS. However as a word of caution to those flying from the US to the UK on AA be aware of the aircraft type when you make your booking. In addition to the new AA Flagship 777-300 the airline also flies the 777-200 which is getting along in age the venerable 767-300 and the 757-200 which in my opinion is not at all suited to Transatlantic travel.",,,Economy,,8,4,4,1,5,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,R Chalmers,United States,3/20/2015,New York (JFK) to Antigua during the very bad snow on the US East Coast. Early morning departure was going well until we reached the gate and found that a problem with a burst pipe meant no baggage could be loaded. However assume this was a knock on from the weather conditions. We were kept relatively well informed about delay which extended to around 3 hrs. However the anticipation of arriving in 85 degrees warmth mitigated the delay. Service on aircraft was fine. We had seats with extra leg room. Inflight entertainment ok. Only soft drinks were free. We had an egg sandwich which was OK. Flight back was also delayed slightly but made up time to arrive near to scheduled time. No queue at immigration. However all this came to nought due to baggage problem at aircraft which meant we waited an hour for bags to arrive. No complaints about flight crew either way - clearly not as customer focused as Non US airlines but efficient.,,,Economy,,8,4,3,3,3,,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,B Robinson,United States,3/18/2015,Flew RDU-LHR on a free economy ticket. I prefer other airlines but the RDU-LHR non-stop convenience trumps all. It also gives me the opportunity to judge the progress of the AA/USAir merger. On the downside the venerable 767-300 is one year older (27 years and counting) still has the mail slot overhead storage bins the ancient hanging screen entertainment and the excruciatingly uncomfortable seats. I did notice that this old warhorse had been updated with blended winglets to save money which I'm certain they pass along to those paying for tickets. On board the hot breakfast croissant has been replaced with a box of sugar laden treats and the dinner has regressed from merely uninteresting to inedible. The flight attendants are excellent given what they have to work with - even giving up their crew rest seats to accommodate the spring breakers who made this a 100% full flight. On the plus side a current movie that I had considered paying to see (Whiplash) swift check-in and 45 minutes early into LHR. AA doesn't seem challenged to upgrade their transatlantic game but unless you're flying from RDU there must be a better option to get from the U.S. to the UK.,,,Economy,,3,2,3,1,1,,,5,1

First disaster came when checking in for flight to be told as a group of 6 we couldn't be seated together. Then it got worse as we couldn't be sat as couples unless we paid $260.00 per couple. Once on board we were sat apart. The cabin crew were at best unkempt and rude. The meal we were served was awful. Only 1 toilet was working for the full economy cabin on a 757 this is not good on a 6 hour flight. Overall a disappointing experience and will not fly on American again.,,,Economy,,4,3,2,2,2,,,3,0

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,A Goddard,United Kingdom,3/17/2015,London - Miami Return January 2015 (Boeing 777). I could only choose where I wanted to sit 24 hrs before my flight which was fine as most airlines have that policy but what really threw me back was that all aisle and window seats cost an extra $69 - $100 each way depending where the seat was located! You have to pay extra for an aisle seat at the back of the plane on a 10hr transatlantic flight? This is not easyjet or Ryanair for goodness sake! The so called cheap flight on a major airline was not so cheap after all as they were already nickel and diming before getting off the ground. I refused to pay and went for a free middle seat which I loath I have wide shoulders and have to hunch inwards my plan was to arrive early and hope the check-in desk could sort me out with an aisle seat which they were able to do but that is where the Customer satisfaction stopped.) Plane was on time and boarding was reasonably quick and I was perched in my aisle seat which was very narrow I also noticed many people getting their roller cases stuck in the aisles as they tried to roll them down but it turns out that in an effort to squeeze an extra seat in each row American Airlines compromised with narrower seats and aisles. In the air nightmare #1 The narrow aisle caused one particular cabin crew to bump the trolley into my shoulder or elbow without even so much as an apology. #2 You get free beer and wine but the entire cabin ran out beer and white wine before the first drinks trolley finished its first pass. #3 The plane was old and the only movies available played at set times (not on demand) that's right 2015 with 90s technology - AA may have painted their planes but they are still old and nasty inside. Worst of all it was the same experience on the return leg mercifully the flight was 60 mins less - A truly awful transatlantic flight!,,,Economy,,2,1,2,1,2,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,B Waldron,United States,3/17/2015,Flying home from Rochester NY to Los Angeles CA I had to change planes in Chicago. Our flight from Rochester landed with plenty of time to make the connecting flight. One problem is that we had to park on the tarmac for one and a half hours. Another plane was occupying the gate. When we reached the gate it took the employees forever to bring up the valeted bags. I missed the connecting flight and it was late in the evening so there wasn't any available flights. I asked about other airlines in the morning and was told nothing was available. I was given stand-by for AA in the morning and if I didn't make that then an 8.05 pm flight was booked for me. AA wouldn't pay for a hotel room so I was on my own. Once I got to a hotel and started my computer I found a United and Virgin America flight for the morning. Of course it cost me more money but I had a meeting the next day and couldn't risk the stand-by status. What a difference dealing with Virgin America customer service over American Airlines. I will only use AA as a last resort in my future trips. American couldn't tell me how many people were on stand-by for the morning flight so I could evaluate my chance of boarding.,,,Economy,,1,2,1,2,2,,,1,0

Things got better on-board first leg on a newly configured 767 as a last minute equipment change. The new First Class seats are extremely comfortable. There were tons of storage space and it went completely flat. Flight attendants on this flight were very friendly pro-active and interactive. Breakfast was delicious and creative. Overall an absolutely delightful flight the new cabin is gorgeous. Return flight in Main Cabin Extra and this time ground staff in MIA was much friendlier than JFK.

I have an appointment when I land and cannot wait for Baggage Claim. What should have been offered was Priority Baggage PickUp.

We fly on European carriers quite often - but American Airlines have made an art of employing non caring - ignorant and unfriendly staff. I have never encountered such condescending flight attendants - and such arrogance. We flew from Dusseldorf to Chicago as first leg. The seat allocation was a disaster at the airport - my wife was in a middle seat 6 rows behind me. When we asked the check in crew to change it - we were told to take care of it at the gate at the gate we were told to sort it with the cabin crew and the cabin crew? Not our problem - you should have taken care of it before boarding - end of interest. Only after I really got angry - and walked off the plane - telling them to get my luggage off - a steward from the front end of the plane got involved and shuffled people around so we could sit together. Our friendly stewardess then managed to ignore us for the whole trip. Second leg - we were on the last row of an ancient DC9 - with the galley next to us and a toilet door that would not close properly. Return trip uneventful - but one thing is certain - never again American.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

Instead of lie- flat seats they still offer lie in s-style and be careful not to slip down to the floor while you sleep. Stewardess climbing over me to cut off the way she had to walk.

Very nice cabin interiors are better than most European airlines. There were only two small things I did not get - table - very difficult to pull out and angle - to a point flight attendants had issues with it. And second was iPad for entertainment? Really. The planes have new seats! What was worst was that the purser collected the iPads and head phones 4 hours before we landed! So there was no entertainment. And when I asked why they collected it so early they said they were preparing for landing. 4 hours ahead? The same on 777-300ER they keep collecting the headphones at least 1 hour before landing therefore you can't use the system. But the food was ok and apart from the unfriendly purser the staff were nice.,,,Business Class,,8,5,3,4,1,,,3,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,D Ruckel,United States,3/17/2015,I traveled reluctantly on American Airlines Buenos Aires - New York and return in early December 2014. On the most recent trip I can only say that the seating was horrible the flight attendants inattentive. I did like two attendants on the return flight one a male who saw the girl sitting next to me unwilling to put her tray up for takeoff and he firmly said 'you know the drill put the tray up'. You could sense his professionalism and no nonsense approach. He was quite professional. Another attendant was very personal with me and admitted that flying was not what it used to be said that the 777-300 had two back seats that you could not recline and actually defended the passenger in terms of lack of comfort. She said that now it is a question of bringing your own entertainment food all of which surprised me since she was not party line and quite personable apologizing for making me wait ten minutes for some water saying 'I'm sorry I'm in another world today' not so reassuring but she was on top of things. A mixed bag. On the flight to New York the food was awful but a flight attendant when telling her that I need a lot of water subtly gave me an entire bottle in a plastic bag. Perhaps it's because I helped an older passenger with her luggage but still what a shocker. I find that I am very uncomfortable getting off their planes. They have twice lost my luggage once on an earlier flight but found it days later. The latest was really just uncomfortable because of the 2x5x2 seating arrangement on a 777-200. I cannot recommend them for comments like 'whose the next victim?' or 'the entertainment system is not working. We suggest you read a good book and go to sleep'. This was on a flight Buenos Aires New York about three years ago stated in Spanish and English by a flight attendant. Passengers laughed but you could see many were offended by her suggestions.

Our flights down were for the most part uneventful with only minor delays out of Calgary and Dallas. However coming back on the 28th of Feb was the worst experience we have ever had in over 30 years of flying. We were stuck in an enormous backlog of passengers in Cancun Airport the majority of the backlog was with American Airlines. Not withstanding the fact that there were storms all over the southern US the American staff assisting passengers in the line-up un-organized cluster that accrued in the terminal was appalling! They could not organize anything and upset passengers constantly. They were so incompetent that they would have had difficulty organizing a staff bathroom break.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,R Stagg,Canada,3/9/2015,"I had an unpleasant experience with this airline on Sunday March 1st. I took a flight from Houston to Chicago then had an hour to connect to my flight to Toronto. The first leg was fine on time and was surprised that a meal was served on a short two hour flight. I got to Chicago checked the departure board and saw my flight was delayed an hour. That was not too bad so I used the washroom came out to get a coffee and decided to check the board for the gate again and to my surprise my flight was then listed as cancelled. Told that even though I had booked first class if I wanted to get to Toronto the next morning it would be in the back of economy told that the only first class available would be in two days. The biggest surprise came shortly thereafter when I went to search for a Customer Relations desk: there was none! There was a system of phones. Eventually a CS agent came to the phone. She told me that the previous gate agent booked me for the following night from Chicago to Philadelphia then a six hour wait to board a 7 am flight back up to Toronto getting me to my destination two days after the original time. I instead took charge and asked if I could get a flight to Buffalo and was placed on one for two hours later. Of course ""weather"" was the cause for the delay but oddly enough only my flight was showing up as being cancelled. I fly often so if weather was a major factor the board should have at least a few more cancellations or delays. Because of this ""weather"" excuse there would be no assistance for a hotel. I was to depart from the L gates and just before boarding there came an announcement that we had to go over to the H gates- - with just minutes to spare. Service has been much better to me by other US based airlines when faced with unusual changes such as weather or mechanical delays-I have had them all. I will stick to my preferred airline and not use AA anymore as this experience plus a similar one last summer with them has completely eroded any confidence that this airline can get me from point A to B on the same day.",,,First Class,,1,3,2,3,1,,,3,0

We got inside and some of the monitors were not working and the seats barely reclined. The flight attendants were very nice and passed out drinks but I still don't understand why they do not offer snacks on a 3.5 hour flight. My flight from MIA-MSP was terrible. We arrived at MIA airport getting ready for our flight at 1pm. We find out it is cancelled and the airline did not give us a reason why so we were rescheduled for a 2pm flight. When we went to board the 2pm flight we find out that they cancelled our seats for that flight and replaced them with a 9pm flight. We had to stay in MIA airport for an additional 7 hours! Once the time finally comes to board the flight bound to MSP we get onto the plane which previously came from Mexico City. The flight attendants were very welcoming however they then tell us over the speaker that this plane was out of service and that American Airlines must find us a new plane to fly on. So we get all of our luggage off the plane and leave the gate once again tired and exhausted. We wait in the gate area and find out our plane is located at the opposite end of MIA airport a 25 minute walk/train ride to get to. So we get all of our stuff together and head towards the other gate. Boarding begins immediately on one of the brand new planes and it is delayed an additional hour. The flight finally leaves at 11pm and I was supposed to be home at 6pm originally. We got to Minneapolis at 2am.

Smooth boarding rock hard seats that sent my back into pain an hour out; surly unhelpful FA's. As we approached the gate in MIA the FA gave us connection information which was wrong. Had we not checked a board in the terminal we would have been sent so far out of our way we would have missed our flight. The other 3 flights were fine except for the MIA-SXM meal which was inedible. Planes were old but fairly well preserved. All flights on time. At SXM our ""priority"" bags were the last off the plane. Overall small stuff.",,,Business Class,,8,4,4,4,4,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Cathy Dunn,Canada,2/24/2015,People are getting bigger not smaller. The seats were uncomfortably tight and small. Entertainment terrible can't they put on a recent movie. Not even a cookie was served! The airline attendants were stone faced. When leaving the plane no attendants present. This is the worst airline we have been on. We will never use it again even if it is cheaper. Flights both going and coming were 45 min to 1 hr delayed. We almost missed our connecting flights both times we were the last to board the plane with rude comments from workers that they are waiting for us!,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M Zheng,United States,2/24/2015,All four of my flight legs were substantially delayed (one because they couldn't find one of the crew members). The airline took no responsibility for the delays-they did not have enough gate agents did not accommodate passengers who missed connecting flights or were trapped in airports overnight as a result of the delays and were extremely rude to passengers who asked for compensation. The seats were also very tight and I could not fit a normal sized backpack fully under the seat in front of me.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

As it turned out we could have arrived earlier on the cheaper flight with another carrier. We were delayed as always when flying AA. Eventually got in over 3 hours late. Asked for some level of compensation for getting in late even though we paid a premium for this particular schedule. Received an email saying we won't be giving any compensation and of course could not reply to the email. Sadly I will no longer fly this carrier.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M Baughman,United States,2/24/2015,"I am mostly an international flyer on Qatar Etihad and BA. I have been flying American a lot in the US in the past 18 months and have to say I have been pleasantly surprised. This weekend there was a bad storm that closed Washington area airports and I had to get back from Miami to make an international departure the following day. Two of my flights were cancelled. The agent at the Admirals Club stuck with it for almost an hour as we strategized a way to get near enough to DCA so I could have options to get home (eventually I got to PHL and rented a car). The only slightly sour note was the agent's supervisor came over saying ""no...no...no.."" and she couldn't be bothered with trying to understand what we were trying to do. Seeing I was now getting really angry the supervisor pulled back and the agent got me near enough on a USAir flight. USAir had their own agent in the Club and he got us on a waitlist for an even earlier flight which proved to be a Godsend. And after all that my baggage eventually made it to DC after the storm with no drama. Of course I am Oneworld Gold and we were flying first class and I didn't have to stand in a mile long line in the main terminal. But that's what you're paying for and often US airlines don't treat you very well no matter how much you paid for the ticket. I also have found AA is incredibly helpful on the phone in changing reservations even on codeshare flights which is something I have to do frequently. Their website is extremely good and links nicely with other airlines if you are on a complicated itinerary that includes one of their flights. I know people who gripe about them but for now they're my go-to US airline.",,,First Class,,9,4,5,3,3,,,4,1

Here's a warning. Our meal was extremely disappointing it was cold and when we complained the meals were taken away and re-heated not safe. Also and worse still was my wife's meal. She needs Gluten Free food but her meal was terrible some chicken and rice which again was cold. When my wife made comments to the senior steward she told us that due to AA cutbacks they are withdrawing special meals. This was not denied by AA customer relations so if you have any kind of special dietary needs do not fly AA. Be warned.,,,First Class,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

I wish the in-the-air product always equalled the consistently excellent service we receive at the Platinum desk. Based on three of the four flights we found the experience professional. The flight however from Montevideo to Miami was characterized by perfunctory service with the crew basically invisible expect for the required meal service. When we boarded they were clustered together laughing. No assistance in boarding the very full plane and throughout the flight. AA has a lock on this flight; should do better.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,J Gardner,United States,2/18/2015,LAX-DFW-MEX and return - First/Business Class. My expectations were set fairly low as these were my 11th and 12th transit of DFW on American over the last 6-7 years but wanted to burn off some miles. Of these trips I can now say that 2 have departed on time out of this place. That said my trip down to MEX was uneventful. Food was fair at best and F/A's smiles seemed missing but was on time. The departure out of MEX back to Dallas was delayed by Radar problems at MEX. This set off a chain of events that resulted in a missed connection at DFW and while 90% could be attributed to the Radar problem. The flight was not posted on airport monitors and the gate was changed. The departure gate did not have the flight displayed so people had to ask if this was indeed for the DFW flight. Once on board the pilot announced a 59 minute traffic delay due to an early full ground stop. That 59 minutes went by plus another 20 or so with no further word from the crew. Late passengers arrived about an hour after the scheduled time and once loaded the door was shut and we pushed back. Since I signed up for Emails I received no fewer than 14 Emails that I didn't read until arrival in DFW which caused connection confusion that even one of their agents could not explain. As it turned out due to carry on bag only I could have made my first flight but apparently they gave my seat away thinking there would be no way I could make it. Coming into DFW I checked online and it showed what looked like I had been rebooked on the 2nd of 2 remaining flights but Emails after arrival which were generic made me think I had been rebooked on the first of the two. All 3 remaining flights were at different terminals which didn't help. Food offered on both return legs was ridiculous same thing on both flights which means they boarded the little biscuit sandwiches at DFW flew them to MEX to serve on the return flight.,,,First Class,,4,4,3,1,1,,,1,0

Their only offer was to travel to Dallas next day and from there to London.

Flight to Bermuda uneventful though only soft drinks served despite being an International flight at dinner hour nary a peanut to be seen. Seat comfort was reasonable for a 1 hr 37 min flight. One flight attendant was extraordinarily rude and sassy loudly scolding numerous passengers about a number of trumped up infractions. Return flight to JFK was overbooked so we and others were hauled into an American Airlines office told we would have to be rebooked the following day. After waiting a while with no further time left to clear customs American told us to be re-booked each passenger would have to pay an additional $298 above the flight ticket already paid plus a fine. American refused even to ask if other flights (Delta or Jet Blue) had space later that day when no one was willing to pay all the extra charges to re-book on American the following morning or even tell us where the other two airlines were located. As it turned out Delta had only Business Class seats available (they said) but Jet Blue could accommodate everyone for a charge of $198 per person. American is clearly not very customer friendly and one would think twice about flying with them again in the future. JetBlue as it turned out had more leg room served a snack and their crew onboard was much better organized and politer than American had been.,,,Economy,,1,2,1,1,2,,,1,0

Took off on time and post-take off drinks were served with nuts. Dinner was halibut that was excellent and the F/A's were very attentive. Bose headsets always great and Samsung tablet had sufficient shows to watch. Slept 4 1/2 hours and asked for breakfast - was brought right away.

Ground and cabin staff were personable passed beverages 4 times on long-haul outbound but service was very lean on return (no coffee on a flight arriving at 5 am). Cabins clean seats adequately cushioned but a tight fit as expected. The entree salad I purchased was tasty and priced fairly. Entertainment is really inadequate on B767-300 with overhead video and no music channels at all on return. Unfortunately American Eagle is really a hot mess except for nice cabin staff. On final segment five schedule changes were sent to my phone in a 30 minute period-30 minute delay no just 5 minutes back to 30 minutes etc. The final message indicated just a 5 minute delay but after we boarded we sat on the plane for another 50 minutes while they located a new captain anyway.

We had a transfer in Chicago that's where the nightmare began. We arrived 15 minutes early but had to wait for almost 1.5 hrs to get off the plane. The pilot said the gate was not clear yet because we were early then they were de-icing then the baggage handlers then crew problems. Our connecting flight was delayed an hour so we would just make it. The flight was scheduled for 10 am delayed until 11 but no gate given then 12 then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 then 6. We found out sometime after 2 that the plane was in Seattle. They never offered an apology although they did give us 12 dollar meal vouchers. We got 2 sandwiches and had to pay for our sodas. We were scheduled to be in Cabo at noon that day but did not get there until 10pm. A day of our vacation was lost 9 hours of aggravation and never offered any compensation for this terrible service. Just a quick comparison we went to Cancun in November on Southwest airlines they had a problem processing our boarding passes 20 minute delay we were afraid we were not going to be able to go but they got the problem fixed.

This meant we couldn't print out boarding passes before getting to the airport. However if we were willing to pay extra $ they would give us seat assignments. In coach. They were basically holding the seats hostage unless we paid a ransom to free them. When I enquired w/ AA as to why they actually said that our $4K payment gave us the ""service"" of flight/flying not the actual seat. They also said seat assignments were handled by the gate.

They went above and beyond looking for an item that I lost during the flight checking the seat cushions and pockets and profusely apologizing when they couldn't find it. Next leg on the 777-300ER. Seats were once again comfortable although legroom was a bit tight but was not much of an issue since I had the entire row to myself. Recline was excellent although it was a little too much that when the person in front of me reclined there was very limited space. Flight attendants on this flight were once again very friendly and professional. Catering was excellent both quantity and quality. Return flight to JFK on a 777-300ER again. This time seated in Main Cabin Extra. Legroom and recline was great there were plenty of space to move around. Flight attendants and catering were once again excellent dinner was one of the best meals I had on a plane. Service on this flight was very attentive. So Kudos to AA! The only issue was the IFE had to be rebooted a couple of times other than that the system offers a lot of variety and options. Overall as a loyal United customer I was pretty impressed with AA!

The old school ""entertainment"" system was a throwback to the 70's and the movie was only available in Spanish. It was a moot point though as I could not see the 12"" screen from a dozen seats away anyhow. The return flight was canceled. We were rebooked the next day on a 777 which was a welcome change. Unfortunately this plane was filthy and the FAs were quite rude. To cap it off as we were boarding we were stopped on the jetway and told that AA has a no outside drinks policy so we would have to throw out the bottles of water we bought airside before boarding our 10 hour flight.

We missed our connecting flight by 6 hours and had to stay in LA. Two granola bars and a pair of headsets.

On check in for this flight at DFW the agent informs us the flight is over sold in economy so we inquire about being switched to British Airways on the non-stop to LHR then on-wards to Milan. The AA Agent looks puzzled and quickly said we cannot switch you to BA. At this point we are confused as AA/BA have a tie up we know for a fact Delta can put you on Air France if the flight is over sold. So then we head to JFK with the domestic leg good on a new plane. At the AA terminal 8 at JFK we come to find out the AA lounge coupons given to use are no good but the AA Agent in the lounge makes an exception for the lounge since Christmas is around the corner. Finally we board the AA flight to Milan. Since we own the AA credit card we are allowed to board with Zone 2 but the red jacket agent stops us saying your AA Credit Card is useless and does not work for zone 2. Finally get on the flight and the flight leaves on time. Meals and service were good as AA has to compete with Emirates on this sector but AA really lacks any economy class in flight entertainment. There are no personal TV screens in each seat like Emirates offers. The seats in economy class are too small on AA. Since AA has put TV screens every few rows no one can sleep on this flight as the lighting from the TV screens is very annoying. To end the flight the Breakfast was very good in economy. Overall if AA would match Emirates with proper in flight offering in economy class they would have a good product but till they do this one is better offer taking Emirates if flying to Milan in Economy class.,,,Economy,,5,2,5,5,1,,,3,1

They don't give priority to board the plane to families with babies nor seniors. Secondly the staff who help you when you are checking in are useless. When you get to the airport you have to check in using their computers but if you are traveling with infants you have to line up for more than an hour. When we lined up an AA employee approached us and confirmed that we were in the right line. One hour later the staff member who was about to help us check in said that we were in the wrong line. Once at the gate they didn't give preference to families with babies. Somebody said through the speaker that there wasn't enough room for our carry-ons and that we had to check them in at no cost. When we approached the staff member at the front desk guy to ask him where to leave the carry on he ignored us. Lastly this airline charges you extra for your luggage.

Although I did sleep most of the time I would have liked to listen to some music or watch a movie of my choice not chosen by them.

SFO-ORD-LHR: flights in Main Cabin Extra. The usual 737 for the internal flight which was fine. Again attentive staff. The leg from ORD to LHR was on a very old and dated 767 which you really no longer would expect to exist in a company from a 1st world country? IFE broke down so everyone had to make do with their own entertainment options. Cabin crew were excellent again. I fell asleep as we took off and missed my meal when I woke up I was offered it within 10-15 minutes.

The MD-80s they fly are fine but the fact that I flew in a plane 5 years younger than me doesn't do much for my faith in the company.

I would like to give American Airlines a poor review on their performance and customer service we experienced on a flight to Sydney Australia in November 2014. Our flight was delayed leaving MSP partially due to weather but really because they left us sitting on the plane while they delayed the de-icing and then took 45 minutes to do something the pilot said usually takes 15 minutes. We missed our connecting flight in DFW that was to take us to Sydney and the ticket attendants there absolutely refused to re-route us onto several flights that could have taken us to LAX to connect to a flight to SYD that same night. They instead put us on a flight the next day that would re-route us through LAX and on to SYD making us lose an entire day in Australia. The ticket attendants were rude and inconsiderate. I have never had such poor customer service in all my years of flying. DFW said it is a policy not to allow someone on a flight through stand-by if their end destination is international. American Airlines said each airport has their own policy on that and it is not a standard AA policy. There were several flights that went from DFW to LAX that evening and they allowed over 30 people to board those planes on stand-by but would not allow us to.,,,Economy,,2,3,1,2,2,,,2,0

Ground staff and cabin crew were rude and inefficient. The cabin and seats were very old and worn out. Not a single crew member on any four of the flights I took even bothered to say hello or welcome or even smile. Obviously we had to purchase snacks onboard because AA does not offer food. The snack options were very limited and if you were seated at the very back of the economy cabin you will never be guaranteed whether you will get the snacks you wanted to buy because they only stock few onboard and they get sold out half way through. Even during the selling of snacks and drinks the cabin crew looked very displeased that they had to do it. The cabin crew were extremely badly groomed. The economy seat had hardly any legroom. If you are a tall person you will have a hard time moving in your seat because it is so small with no legroom. We even bought extra legroom seats and still there was not enough legroom. All four flights were delayed and took off hours late. We were boarded late and then had to sit in the aircraft for at least 1 to 2 hours before take off. As a result our plans had to be cancelled and changed. I will never fly with AA again.,,,Economy,,,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

Service was very good from the crew who were pleasant friendly and were happy to keep your drink topped up. If you're feeling peckish during the flight the galley is stocked with snacks where you can help yourself. Overall a very pleasant on time flight. In contrast I flew the return with BA on a very worn 747 business class cabin is badly designed and crew not very friendly at all. If you are doing this route definitely choose AA over BA miles better product!,,,Business Class,,10,5,5,4,4,,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,A Martinez,United States,1/19/2015,I have never seen anything like I saw today at MIA. We arrived an hour and a half before my son's domestic flight and could not believe the chaos at American's ticket counters. There were long lines at every kiosk and even longer lines at the checked bag line. After finally checking in at a kiosk my son could not print his boarding pass because the machine had run out of paper. I had been standing in the checked bag line and when we approached the employee and explained that we had a luggage tag but the boarding pass had not printed she directed us to another line that had easily more than 60 people! I then approached another American Airlines employee and asked for assistance and she was incredibly rude and offered no help. Fortunately we were able to get my son's boarding pass on the phone. Despite a ridiculous security check-in line he was able to board his flight on time. A friend of his that was on the same flight had to forcefully argue with other employees to get on the flight because they said they had closed the gate and would not let him board even though he was checked in!,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Alberto Garcia,United States,1/19/2015,Last January 13th I took my flight back from Madrid Spain to JFK AA 095 we started our flight two hours late not being informed about time or anything similar we were not allowed to leave the area inside the airport where our plane was and if we wanted they said that they would open our carry-on bags totally. We boarded and when we were boarding they informed us that we had a stop in Goose bay Canada to have gas otherwise we would not be able to get to New York the stop was 1h 30m long. We arrive in JFK so late that almost everybody lost their connection. However we were given new connections once we got out of the plane. But they did not give us any voucher or anything in compensation for this horrible flight. I would try not to fly American Airlines again.,,,Economy,,1,2,3,2,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Anne Thompson,United Kingdom,1/19/2015,Flight Miami to LHR 13/01. Technically the flight was good early arrival very soft touchdown and excellent information from flight deck. However the cabin service left a lot to be desired. The crew were very unhelpful and the food poor by the standards of comparable airlines. Our return trip to the UK (operated by AA) was far inferior to our outward trip to Boston operated by BA. Given the choice at a comparable price level I would not fly with AA again.,,,Economy,,1,3,1,1,1,,,1,0

Flight from MIA to VRP was canceled because the AA crew did not show up. Service crew for the make-up flight were very nice and accommodating but the AA staff at MIA were not very friendly at all and we had to search for them after seeing our flight was canceled. On all legs the planes were AA and not very clean at all.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Marci Sams,United States,1/19/2015,"I recently flew from Brazil to Los Angeles on American Airlines and it was the longest most uncomfortable international flight I have ever been on. In addition to the dirty looking and old interior the broken flush button on the toilet and the only semi-functioning ""entertainment"" device the staff were rude and had horrible attitudes. One flight attendant actually rolled her eyes at me when I asked for headphones. Her response was ""Don't you have an iPod or something that you have headphones for"". When I said no she rolled her eyes and said she would see if they had any but everyone brings their own headphones now. The food was horrible as well. It was the most unpleasant flying experience I have ever had. I will avoid flying American Airlines at all costs in the future.",,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

Los Angeles to Las Vegas 30 Dec 2014 AA182. Las Vegas to New York 4 Jan 2015 AA120. My partner and I were extremely disappointed with everything. All 4 flights were delayed not by few minutes but by hours. Later the staff would board all passengers on to the aircraft and in all the flights we would just sit on the tarmac for hours. Usually when you board the plane the CSD or the purser of the flight would greet you with a friendly smile and say welcome aboard or good morning etc. But in all the flights with AA they could not care less about passengers. Flight attendants were too busy talking to each other or. The grooming of the flight attendants was atrocious! Above all the flight attendants on all 4 flights were very rude and arrogant. They don't even bother to look or smile or talk politely with the passengers when they are boarding the flight. The seats in economy was so uncomfortable with minimal leg room. There is no comfort. It is okay for short flights but not very good for long flights like New York to San Francisco or Las Vegas to New York. We paid extra for extra legroom economy seats. Well AA should learn what extra legroom means. There was no extra legroom. The seats are terrible for tall people. I will never recommend AA.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

Typical AA flights and lounges- pretty ordinary. Not a patch on Qantas or BA. Ground staff at RDU did not recognise or acknowledge an international RTW J class ticket - denied baggage allowance. Had to pay $25 to check 1 bag. Why don't AA enforce carry-on bag rules? Many passengers with 3 or more overweight bags. Would we recommend AA to family & friends? Probably as they are 'less bad' than the opposition.,,,Business Class,,6,3,2,3,1,,,3,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,A Brown,United States,1/19/2015,SAN-ORD-ROC and BUF-ORD-SAN. I decided to fly paid first as the cost when booking only a few weeks out was only slightly more than economy. I've flown AA first domestically many times so didn't expect much but flying so early in the morning it was nice to have a slightly larger seat to sleep. I'm only writing this review to point out what a drastic turn for the worse after the merger. The food quality while on domestic F is never great has always been better than the rest on AA. It is now absolutely disgusting. The one positive is that first is now offered on American Eagle - a very minor improvement of course for a flight so short in duration. I really hope management wakes up and realizes that they are ruining what was a much better than average airline.,,,First Class,,5,3,4,1,1,,,1,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Jeff Gorham,United States,1/19/2015,"Traveled three times round trip LAX to LHR in the last 4 months of 2014: flights 136 and 135. Equipment - 777 300ER (I go out of my way to fly this plane as it is the newest and most comfortable). Business Class. Seats J12 J13 and J14 (window seats). I can't say enough good things about the seat (private and roomy flat bed) the inflight entertainment (15"" screen) and the noise-canceling headphones (sized large enough to surround the ear rather than mashing it as do the headphones on BA). In all instances the food from LAX to LHR was not good and certainly not worth the calories (the same can be said for BA). Better to eat in the Admirals Club Lounge (more on this later). The food from LHR to LAX was much better and excellent on one flight (must have a better kitchen at LHR). The LAX Admirals Lounge is comfortable enough but it is unconscionable that long-haul business class passengers are required to pay for everything beyond bar snacks and coffee. I have never paid for food in the business class lounge of any other comparably-sized airline. And we were mislead (cheated) by one of the wait staff. As an aside BA shares the Admirals Club Lounge in San Diego and as a BA passenger I wasn't charged for food in the lounge there. The LHR Admirals Club Lounge is certainly spartan but well-tended and thankfully much less crowded than the BA lounge. In fact the AA lounge was just about empty on my three visits. Yes the food in the AA lounge is limited compared to BA but at least you don't have to pay extra for it as you do in all of the Admirals Clubs in the USA. Check-in was spotty at best and miserable at worst. At LHR we had to use the check-in desk for coach passengers because there was only one business class desk in operation. I would recommend AA but only for passengers flying business class in the 777 300ER aircraft.",,,Business Class,,8,5,4,3,5,,,4,1

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,J Jensen,United States,1/14/2015,"NRT/ORD 777-300 I hesitated booking F/class on AA even with award travel because of their flight attendants' general culture of hostility towards passengers but I reasoned I'd be asleep for much of the flight. We sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes before taking off. When returning to my seat from the lavatory after we'd finally reached cruising altitude a flight attendant looked at me coldly and barked ""Put your seat belt on!"". There was some turbulence but this was not the way to handle it. The purser was friendly and efficient but he referred to my husband as ""Mr.---- "" and called me ""Dear"". The new seats were very comfortable though and I liked that my husband and I could spin the seats to face each other while dining (although the food was surprisingly bad). I slept well on the comfortable flat bed. If the food and service were comparable to the seat it would have been a great flight. Until then I'll continue to book transpacific premium travel on Asian carriers.",,,First Class,,5,5,3,2,2,,,2,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,D Thorpe,United Kingdom,1/14/2015,"I dread flying with American Airlines but with their association with British Airways (Who are fantastic) I have to for internal American Flights. Last flight was from Boston to New York with an onward BA connection to London. Arrived at Boston airport for check in very rude AA check in attendant who was unhelpful and just plain miserable. Onwards to the departure gate screens indicated a 25 minute delay. Was not too concerned as had around 4 hours to connect onto BA flight once landed in JFK. We then spent 2.5 hours waiting at the gate with hardly any communication from AA staff apart from ""Its a weather delay"" turns out it was due to a faulty aircraft door. Anyway the four hour connection time was fast approaching and people were starting to become annoyed and very irritated. Finally ushered onto the aircraft at speed as we only had a window of 25 minutes to board and be airborne if not flight would be cancelled as the crew would be out of hours. We boarded the aircraft and took off with around 4 minutes to spare. Seatbelt signs stayed on for the whole flight and apparently due to adverse weather the crew would also remain seated so no food or drinks would be served. I have honestly never been on an AA flight whereby the crew are smiling happy to serve you and are actually grateful for you flying with them and I have taken around 8 AA flights including across the pond the attitude at times is appalling. On the same holiday I was on a delayed Delta flight from Atlanta to Boston and the difference between staff was unbelievable was even given a free beer and sincere apology for the delay and more importantly was kept informed and the crew were cheerful and happy.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,V Pili,United States,1/14/2015,"I am a long time traveler and loyal to American Airlines however whoever designed these ""new"" planes must have been 2 feet tall. The design is terrible. I am a slim 5'10"" and sat in a ""premium"" economy seat from Washington DC/LA on a nearly 6 hour flight. I sat next to two other tall people making it even more unpleasant. I will start with the good American has finally come into the 21st century and provides individual screens for in flight entertainment but still not nearly as good as Virgin America which also offers many free viewing options TV etc. Chargers USB are improved as well. Now the bad - the leg room and more so the seat/tray table configuration (even in premium) is appalling and even worse if the person in front of you reclines their seat which is highly likely. In my case they did and my drink ended up in my lap. If the seat in front is reclined you are pretty much trapped. The head rest ""wings"" that allow you to rest your head from side to side are so small anyone with a normal size head could not possibly use. They are ridiculous. The seat pocket basically holds nothing forget stocking up on magazines and books for your long flight as you will be carrying them in your lap or chucking them on the floor. Though it's nice to fly in a nicer and newer plane it is just shocking that no consideration was given to traveler comfort on these new planes especially if you are a over 5'2"". Not sure how the American or Boeing CEOs didn't catch this. They must have only tested out first class or they are all really short!",,,Premium Economy,,2,1,3,1,2,,,2,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Liam Wills,United States,1/14/2015,AA174 (Raleigh RDU-London LHR) on Dec 23 2014. We initially boarded the old rust bucket that is the 767-300 only to be disembarked a couple of hours later due to mechanical problems. They told us mechanics would have the problem fixed in 2 hours only for the inevitable announcement 3 hours later that they couldn't fix the plane and that we would depart the next morning. AA did provide hotels overnight but it was another 2 hour ordeal with 250 passengers lining up to see ONE representative. The next morning we all made our way to the gate boarded the same plane which the captain announced had been fixed and tested and waited for departure. Only we never departed. One hour later the captain announced the plane was STILL not fit to fly to the annoyance of us passengers. We had to wait a further 7 hours at the airport for another AA rust bucket 767 to come save us from London. After a 24 hour delay and 3 separate boardings for 1 flight we finally made it to London Christmas morning. My return flight (AA105) from London LHR to New York JFK operated on a brand new 777-300 was of course flawless. Lesson learned and tip: Do everything you can to avoid flying the 767 because chances are you won't be flying. They were good planes back in the 90's and 00's but they're unreliable these days. Moreover if you want entertainment and comfort avoid 767s at all costs. Ultimately AA is a good airline if you fly the right planes.,,,Economy,,5,4,2,3,3,,,4,1

The more leg room you get the narrower the seat gets! 8 hrs in a cramped seat is ridiculous. My husband and I had seats 15a & b and left the armrest up between us to give us room for our arms the passenger in seat c I am thankful to say did the same thing. Seriously removing rows of seats to gain additional leg room is one thing but reducing seat widths to cram in more seats is in my opinion the most ridiculous idea they ever had.

The first flight was not good. The seats were uncomfortable and the IFE (even though it was the ceiling types) were not working. All they gave was drinks and food was way over priced. This made a 4 hour flight seem like a 9 hour flight. There were no delays or problems with check-in. On the way back we were delayed a day but that was our choice. The same plane on the way back had a faulty fuel pump and could not be fixed at Cabo. So if they were to fly the aircraft was way overweight. The pilot announced that 20 people had to leave the aircraft or everyone could fly but only 40 baggage could be kept onboard. The flight was full so that would leave at least 200 people stranded in ORD. My family had no intention to fly a 4 hour flight with a faulty fuel pump so we exited the aircraft. Plus who wouldn't want an extra day in a tropical place? American Airlines gave us one night at an all- inclusive resort on the ocean with free transportation to and from the resort. They had also booked us for the flight the next day. That was the good part. The next day the gate was crowded because they were trying to board two flights at one gate. It was a total disaster.

Seat wider than expected and quite private. Huge amount of space and loads of storage places too - even a large wardrobe. Power points convenient (UK and US plugs both fitted). Good noise cancelling headphones. Quiet. I was in 3A which is a mini-cabin just behind First Class - I would recommend it again. AA Business class is better than BA First Class Wifi: speeds of 3-7Mb which was commendable and only £9 approx. for the whole flight - very reasonable too considering the technology costs involved. Food: ok but not special. However snack bar had loads of nice nibbles.,,,Business Class,,10,5,5,4,5,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Jezrel Sabaduquia,United States,12/18/2014,AUS-DFW-LGA. First leg on a MD-80 old aircraft but very well maintained. Plane was spotless and the seats were comfortable especially the very plush headrest. Legroom was sufficient and flight attendants managed to a conduct a beverage service on a full flight despite a flight time of only 39 minutes. Connection at DFW was seamless. Flight to LGA on a 737-800 had the seat next to me empty which provided a more comfortable flight. Flight attendants were very young which was surprising. They were friendly and cheerful which is a nice change. Refreshments and entertainment were basic and WiFi was extremely slow. Was disappointed that I shelled out money for a slow connection that only started to speed up during descent.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,3,3,,,5,1

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Courtney Phillips,United States,12/10/2014,Scheduled to leave from Sacramento CA at 8am on 11/24/14. I got an automated call Sunday evening at around 11.30pm stating that my flight out of Sacramento would be delayed until 9:37AM. I was fine with this - I realize delays happen. I still arrived at the airport as if my flight were to leave at it's original 8am departure just in case. When I arrived at the American Airlines counter the women working there proceeded to tell me that because of this delay there would be no way for me to make my connection in Dallas to Montgomery. She made me feel confident that I would indeed miss my connection in Dallas. She said she had changed my flight connection in Dallas to an 9pm departure instead of the original 3.15pm flight out to Montgomery. I wasn't thrilled that I would be arriving much later but it would work. The flight from Sacramento arrived in Dallas at 2:45PM. I had thirty minutes to make my original flight. I made it with a couple minutes to spare. The women at the counter looked up my name and said I could no longer get onto this flight because my flight itinerary had been changed. I then was stuck in Dallas Airport for over 6 hours. AA staff I had talked to about my situation had any sympathy for the situation which made me even more angry. It was nothing but a speed bump into their work day. I would never recommend flying with American Airlines.,,,Economy,,2,1,1,2,1,,,1,0

Despite the aircraft arriving 20 min later than scheduled boarding time in Atlanta flight was able to depart close to on time. Flight arrived DFW 10 min early. Cabin crew was pleasant but not overly friendly. All in all a good flight. Flight duration is only 2 hrs so not much time for entertainment and food.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,David Hodgkiss,United Kingdom,12/4/2014,Manchester to New York. Their standards are poor even from arriving at the boarding gate - why split passengers into groups and then not pay attention to how those groups board the plane? Surely after business class and those with priority shouldn't the next set of passengers to board the plane be those at the rear. That process would help to ensure the plane left on time rather than almost 20 minutes late. Their fleet is old-fashioned with screens down the centre aisle which cannot be viewed from certain seats. The seats were uncomfortable - 8 hours spent in one of those is not a pleasant experience. We gained the impression that the crew and their requirements over-rode passenger considerations - clearing away too quickly before passengers had time to finish the poor quality meals having to be quiet whilst in the vicinity of sleeping staff and very few drinks/snacks being offered is not what long haul flights should be about. Even the crew's uniform was shabby.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

We flew from Manchester to New York direct the inbound flight took 9 hours seats where uncomfortable they only had televisions in the aisle - no PTV and no headphones provided. Served food half an hour into the flight then left for 7 hours without anybody asking us if we needed a drink - received a smaller snack 40 mins before landing which made you feel you had to rush as they where already standing waiting for the rubbish before you had finished.

Connecting flights at Miami are the worst specially international flights. They schedule connecting flights within an hour and a half apart yet they land every international flight at terminal D in Miami 5-10 mins apart. On top of all this their outbound flights are late and incoming planes have to wait to have a new gate. What is the issue with this immigration and customs are 1 hour behind making it difficult to connect. You would think the airline can have someone trying to help you get through or guide you to reconnect to another flight well that is not the case.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Alan Stuart,United States,12/1/2014,"I flew DFW-LHR-DFW on AA50 and AA51. Both sectors were on a 777-300er. This is an excellent aircraft. Very spacious quiet and comfortable. AA's business class is by far the best product across the Atlantic. (Make sure that you book on the 77W. If you don't you will get the inferior 777-200 and it really isn't as good as the 300er). The fact that there is only one seat for rows A and J means that you have two windows plenty of space and lots of privacy. The lie flat bed is comfortable and easy to operate. The IFE has plenty of movies TV shows and plenty to keep you entertained. The food is very good with good choices. The walk up kitchen is kept well stocked with many tasty things. You will not go hungry on this flight! The crews were great and of course the flight deck were professional and got us to our destination safely which is always a good thing! The on board wi-fi is fantastic but please don't be a bandwidth bore and use it for ""voice"" calls like the idiot across the aisle from me did all the way to London. He was so annoying I had to complain to the flight crew to get him to shut up. AA have a great product here if they drop the 777-300er on this route as I was told they were going to do it will be a mistake. I will not fly with them.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M David,United States,12/1/2014,FLL-DFW-LAX upgrade to First. I have to admit the 737-800's are ok but need a refresh. I flew the segment from FLL-DFW it was an upgrade. OK good service. Met service manager for AA sitting next to me. She could not have been nicer. Really pleasant flight. DFW-LAX on the new Airbuses 320-B really great for the length although the seats could recline a bit more considering it is a 3 hour flight and it is hub-hub for AA. Food was OK nothing to write home about but they will upgrade that so look forward to it. No pre-flight welcome drinks - big minus. The seats - great although all leather which is a set back for AA I tend to sweat a lot and I find fabric gives you a bit more breathing. Entertainment - better than British on international flights. Large screens great selections of movies TV this is where AA is getting their game above their competition but they need to keep going. Keep changing the selection more often and staying on top of it alla Emirates. Comparable to the best though. I fly a lot including ANA JL QF BA CX and AA is on par if not above in many.

Traveling through the US and Canada during November found me on several AA flights most in first class with upgrades a few in economy. On balance the flights were ok nothing special no notable problems. Most flights were on or close to schedule service was generally better than expected. The biggest negative is AA's equipment on these routes. All B737 or MD Super 80 aircraft. Generally confining for mid-long haul domestic and the S80s are just so old it is a wonder that AA still uses them as much as they do - not a very passenger friendly aircraft.,,,First Class,,7,2,3,2,1,,,3,0

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Shannon Broyles,United States,11/20/2014,What began as a simple flight from San Jose CA to New York NY (JFK) connecting at LAX has resulted in frustration and anger. Upon arriving at San Jose international airport with two hours to spare my fiancé and I each checked a bag. Our flight was projected to leave at 2.45pm PST and read 'On Time' on the departures kiosk. Without any announcement or updates our flight arrived late had to be refuelled and in turn was 30 minutes delayed. We missed our connection at LAX by five minutes and after spending far too much time in the customer service office were rebooked on a 9.30 Delta flight to JFK. Told there was no need to check-in all we would have to do is go to the gate and speak to the representative at the counter. An hour before our flight we walk to the appropriate gate only to be told that while we were listed as passengers there were no seats for us and that American should have booked seats on our behalf. We returned to the customer service office spending an hour waiting in line. An American Airlines rep took us from counter to counter trying to find us two seats on any plane. The only availability was on a place via Nashville to LaGuardia with an hour layover. As we were boarding we were pulled off the plane because he had found us a direct flight to JFK which would make finding our bags that much better. Finally arriving in JFK at 7.15 am our bags were nowhere to be found.,,,Economy,,1,1,2,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,H Stewart,United Kingdom,11/20/2014,JFK to Orlando in First. Check-in staff very helpful to our party of 6 after arrival from London. Given access to Admirals Club because long-haul had been business class. Pleasant lounge but only stayed about 20 minutes. Priority boarding and seats comfortable for a medium-length domestic flight. Captain announced that he would delay take-off whilst 35 passengers from a delayed European flight made the transfer and took off when about half that number had boarded. But the real surprise was when the flight attendant came round and said that because of the timing (early afternoon) there was no catering on the flight. Thus a 3-hour flight with just several rounds of a basket containing nuts biscuits and crisps - not a first class offering. Other than that the whole experience was much better (with arrival only slightly delayed) than I had feared given some of the reviews on here.,,,First Class,,6,5,3,1,3,,,3,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M Thompson,United States,11/17/2014,Paid for F Class JFK-MCO via MIA. AA's JFK Terminal is beautiful. Dedicated F class check in with arrogant staff agents should be mindful of vocal tones and questions. Premium Security line ended up not being during slow time of day as TSA putting 3 non premium bodies to 1 in the same scanner line even though another was available. I purchased a day pass for the Admirals Club as I was quite early for my flight. The JFK Lounge is very nice service was good staff were very kind especially the lady at reception. Purchased a Fruit and Cheese Plate and was surprised in a happy way. Flt to MIA in a 757 intl config. with angle lie flat 2X2 seated at the window. The seats are awkward to get in/out of when upright impossible to escape a window seat with another either sitting or laying down. I tried the angle lie flat position and lasted less than 30 min. in that position simply uncomfortable might as well stand in the galley. The Lay-z-boy option of recline is very nice. PDB was offered no restrictions. Nice looking IFE pity I was never offered headsets to use it. Cocktails with nuts in a bowl served after take off then dinner. AA seems to have downgraded the nut mix with less premium nuts in the mix. The dinner was the biggest shock. The Pre ordered Lasagne was vile and the salad pathetic. Club in Miami is ok with pleasant staff. MIA-MCO in 757 Dom. config. FA's awful on this leg. Airplane broke after we boarded no one seemed to have a clue what to do next. Gate agents and Admirals Club unable to contact ops via phone for updates. No words. Next plane boarded later than promised with no reason offered.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,N Gates,United Kingdom,11/17/2014,"Based upon our experience of American Airlines' flights from the USA to the UK several years ago and to reduce the effects of jet-lag my wife and I decided to take the daytime flight AA90 which departs Chicago (ORD) at 09.05 and arrives in London (LHR) at 22.45. In retrospect this was a mistake. The Chicago Admiral's Club lounge was most disappointing. Surprisingly no food (unless you paid for it) was available except a few sad-looking bagels and muffins. So we were hungry when the flight took off. We were seated in seats 2A & 2B (the first row on the B767-300ER aircraft) and the seats were comfortable enough with good leg room. However the aircraft was certainly showing its age. In business class (there is no first class on this flight) there are no seat-back screens and the passengers are given small tablets and Bose headphones on which to watch movies. The movie/music selection was poor and was nothing to get excited about. The food that we were served (breakfast and a pre- landing ""snack"") was probably the worst airline food we have ever experienced. It was virtually inedible and it compared extremely unfavourably with the food that we were served in British Airways business class on our flight to the USA three weeks earlier. Furthermore the cabin attendants were virtually invisible. On the eight-hour flight I was never once offered tea or coffee - all I was given was a bottle of water to drink. Two hours before the flight landed in London I had to find a flight attendant and ask for a Bacardi and Coke - no flight attendant ever asked me if I would like something to drink. Unlike British Airways business class on our American Airlines flight we could see no sign of a basket in the kitchen area containing anything to snack on (like bars and sweets). American Airlines do you think that this is acceptable? Just what are business class passengers paying several thousand dollars/pounds over the economy fare for? (You do not arrive any earlier than the people sitting in the back). The food and service we experienced on our flight from ORD to LHR were completely unacceptable and based on our recent experience fear that it will be a very long time before we fly on American Airlines in business class again.",,,Business Class,,1,2,1,1,2,,,1,0

San Jose is certainly a very pleasant little airport but unfortunately there is no American Airlines Admiral's Club room for first and business passengers. Our seats on the aircraft (3A & 3B - the first row of seats on the B737-800) were fairly comfortable and there was enough leg room. We had pre-ordered our meal on-line and it was described as miso chicken. Our meals although nicely served were of very poor quality so much so that my wife refused to eat any more after the first few mouthfuls. The flight attendant who looked after us was pleasant. courteous and helpful.

Great plane - in fact I'd say superb. Nice roomy first class that I'd be happy with on a 3-4 hour hour flight. Nice FAs. Plane both ways was rammed from end to end.

The food wasn't too bad on the way out but if you suffered any dietary requirements it was tough. The flight ran out of certain drinks outbound and on the return journey. On the return journey we were sat at the back and we had to settle for what was left food wise as they'd run out of one of the options. The majority of the attendants were either rude sarcastic and had obviously missed the training session on customer service. Inflight entertainment was poor AA seem to be stuck in the dark ages with one tiny screen for every few seats.

I paid $59 to stretch my legs and I choose the first row after business class. There was a division panel so in fact there wasn't much room.

I avoided the AA Flagship lounge at LHR T3 as I had read so many bad reviews. The BA alternative was okay. The plane was brand new and the new seat was fine. There are only 8 seats in the AA 1st Class on this plane. Nothing spectacular. It was roomy good TV good seat controls and a neat feature was the rotation to face out of the window. Food was well just okay. Nothing very stylish. A trout timbale to start. A nice spicey butternut squash soup came next. Boring salad - seen better in M&S. Chicken main was - well okay. Had better in my local pub. FAs were friendly and called passengers by name. For the money it was acceptable. Certainly not worth $10-12000+ return which is often the regular list price to LAX.

First of all the planes wouldn't look out of place in a museum I haven't seen such an antiquated IFE system since the 1990's - suspended CRT monitors and they have the gall to charge nearly $6 a head for headphones. The food is awful with no choice to speak of - breakfast on both flights was a choice between omelette or scrambled egg since my daughter will not eat egg dishes on the outbound flight we asked if they could provide an alternative were curtly told we should have ordered a special diet meal. On the return flight we upset the crew by taking my daughters breakfast on board with us. The final meal - no choice just pizza. On both flights it was served so late that no sooner had we opened our cutlery than we were begin badgered by give up our trays as the crew needed to prepare for landing. During the outbound flight having slept for four hours and with no response to the call button I walked back to the galley to request a drink for myself and my family only to be told ""You have run us all ragged on this flight so we have closed up the galley and are resting so you'll have to wait for the meal"".",,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

They don't serve food in economy on internal flights and I realise they are not SQ or CX but for the price I paid they are fine.

As former Cabin crew myself I was astonished at the poor and lack of service on board. On the outbound flight there was no service for over 2.5 hrs as turbulence was expected. There was no attempt at any service during this time and the meal and drink were almost flung at us. I don't recall being offered a hot drink! No more service until the snack service which was an undercooked pizza. Pretty basic for a 9 hr day flight the return flight was no better. No drinks were served with breakfast as more turbulence was expected! There was no turbulence - in my opinion the crew didn't leave themselves enough time to carry out a full service. Considering the cost of the flight and the other ways airlines have of extracting money from pax such as priority boarding and choosing seats etc I expected better service and at least some courtesy! We felt that the service we received was unsatisfactory. I will not be recommending American Airlines after our disappointing experience.,,,Economy,,2,3,1,3,4,,,2,0

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Nigel Key,United States,10/31/2014,AA is an embarrassment to US hospitality and service. I frequently fly business class transatlantic - have you tried to get past a neighbor who is lying flat to reach the aisle? It's almost impossible as the seats are so badly positioned and designed. And what about the Business lounge H at Heathrow the food available and decor are awful compared to any other major world airline - yes including some US competitors. Finally I am tired of the grumpy geriatric flight attendants that seem to dominate the ranks. All US airlines have lost ground compared to their European peers but AA is down at the bottom of the pile.,,,Business Class,,3,2,2,2,3,,,2,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Laura Fulton,United Kingdom,10/31/2014,Awful experience. The cabin crew are amongst the rudest least helpful people you are likely to come across in life. I was travelling with two small children 2years and 8months. Having spent the majority of the flight on my feet rocking my 8mth old to sleep she finally fell asleep. Breakfast arrived unfortunately I knocked the tray onto the floor. The member of cabin crew stepped over it ignoring it. When I apologised and asked for help to pick it up he curtly said he would get it later. The breakfast was strewn all over the floor in front of the toilet. I had a sleeping baby in my arms. When another passenger woke up half an hour later my fellow passenger was kind enough to pick the items up.,,,Economy,,2,2,1,1,3,,,2,0

There were no in seat videos on the Boeing 767. The overhead screens continued to play movies until just before landing which prevented me form sleeping.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Canavan Alison,United Kingdom,10/28/2014,This was my first and last time with American Airlines. Booked with British Airways from Dublin to Orlando. Flight out was fine as it was with BA but return was with AA - as they are partners of BA I thought the service would be the same. How wrong I was - flight was 2.5 hours delayed which meant we missed our flight from Dublin to Glasgow. I had to pay £190 to rebook flights. We were only allowed 1 checked bag each but with BA we were allowed 2 each. The stewardesses only came round once with drinks service and you had to pay for spirits. Plane seemed old. No inflight entertainment system in the back of seat instead TVs that came down where everyone had to watch the same film. No leg room at all. Very narrow seats that were extremely uncomfortable. I never complain about anything and when I read the reviews before our flight I thought they were exaggerated but honestly it's the worst flight I have ever been on and I wouldn't fly with them again even if it was free.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,J Humeau,France,10/28/2014,I flew from CDG to JFK on October 14th. It was the cheapest direct flight which was quite punctual. So the basis is 100% fulfilled. But the overhead compartment opened during take off and things fell down. It reopened during landing. When I left the plane I said it to the steward he did not ask me where it was located. Just something common. In addition to this half of the flight was in the dark because of an electric malfunction that prevented us calling for assistance. That is the visible part of the aircraft for the passenger. To fly in an old plane ok but it has to be nicely maintained.,,,Economy,,2,3,3,2,1,,,4,0

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,A Dhuka,United Kingdom,10/22/2014,"I was flying from Miami - Sao Paulo on AA929 on the 10th July 2014 on a 772ER in First. Having arrived from LAX 2 hours prior I was absolutely exhausted and was hoping to get some sleep on this leg. Boarding was smooth and the flight took off on time once the aircraft had reached cruising altitude and the seat belt sign was turned off I made my way to the galley and requested one of the two FA's (both were busy discussing their personal problems rather then attending to passengers) to turn down my bed I received a shocking impertinent response from her: ""So you want me to push a button for you"". Disgruntled and furious I prepared the bed myself and slept for the remainder of the flight. Around an hour before landing I was poked and woken up by the same rude flight attendant. At that point I expressed my frustration and told her she was not fit for purpose and shouldn't be working customer service orientated role. American Airlines has a good product in First (for a North American airline) I managed to sleep comfortably; however their poorly trained rude staff make it an unpleasant experience. Upon completing my flight I cancelled my return with AA and subsequently purchased a new flight with TAM which has a far superior product and customer service it's a shame they're suspending their first class on all routes from early next year.",,,First Class,,4,4,1,2,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,K Lim,United States,10/22/2014,October 9 2014 AA 137 DFW to HKG. Flight departed Dallas pretty much on time. Once airborne hot paper towels were distributed following by drink service. Complimentary beers and wine. Shortly after drink service lunch was served followed by another round of drink service. Special vegetarian meal was provided. Meal consisted of rice and chick peas curry with a side salad with olive oil dressing and two pieces of melon as desert. Tiny quantity but tasted decent and edible. About 7 or 8 hours into the flight a mid flight snack was served with drinks. Three pieces of vegetarian wraps and a fruit salad was served. Less than two hours before landing in Hong Kong another meal was served. This time the meal was a cold pasta salad with two pieces of cantaloupe melon. Flight was about a little over 16 hours. Seats in Main Cabin Extra were fairly comfortable. Flight crew was professional but lack the grace of Asian carriers flight crew. No other amenities were provided like other Asian carriers such as toothbrush socks eye masks etc. However a refreshments self service counter was set up in the galley and juices and water were available through out the flight. IFE was surprisingly good with many new movies and TV shows available on demand. No flight deck announcement but flight crew provided information in English Cantonese and Mandarin. All in all a satisfactory flight with inexpensive fare compared to Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines but nothing special. Flight crew did not attempt to make passengers feel particularly welcome nor rude to passengers. Better than expected.,,,Economy,,7,3,3,2,4,,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,R Heather,United States,10/22/2014,I recently flew from Chicago to Dublin Ireland on American Airlines - never again. The planes on both legs were filthy the toilets stank there was no individual IFE only shared screens on a 8.5 hour transatlantic flight the cabin crew were the rudest most unfriendly people I have ever met everybody sitting around me agreed. People had asked for blankets etc. but never got them. And to add insult to injury we were delayed 2.5 hours out of Dublin the crew didn't apologize and hit and the back so as to not have to deal with the passengers. If traveling from Chicago to Dublin I highly recommend either Aer Lingus or United. Both have good IFE their planes are clean and their staff are pleasant and accommodating. American Airlines in my opinion has gone downhill despite all their promises of improving their planes and services.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Mike Silver,United Kingdom,10/22/2014,Flew with AA Flight 734 Miami to Philadelphia to connect to Manchester on 30th September. The outbound flights both with US Airways. AA refused point bank to help me book the seats for 734 when I rang the UK customer services. Both agents need a training course last one told me to arrange seats at airport. US Airways helped me with seats for my family on their 3 legs. I tried to log in to my flight the night before to book seats to together and found to my horror there were no seats together and I had no choice but to choose from the few left. Arrived at Miami and flight was showing on time. Shortly before take off it became a 30 minute delay. Many people waiting concerned as they had connections like us. Some had no boarding passes for their US airways flight as they could not print these on check in. Unhelpful lady at desk would not help meaning those without passes then had to go chasing around PHL airport to get passes printed. Flight landed 30 minutes late cue rush as the plane was packed and most had connections to make. We were lucky as our flight departed from Terminal A. Still it left no time to go to any shops or buy food and drink. For their abysmal customer service for refusing to help me but worse by far for the first time in my life having my entire family split up on a plane and having to sit with total strangers I will boycott AA. US Airways in contrast were very good and helpful. Goodbye AA they just don't seem to care anymore. Had to give 1 star for entertainment. Should be a 0 option as unless you pay you get nothing! Wifi?

The flight attendants response? 'Oh I'm not sure what I can do about that.' Disgusting customer service. The so called 'entertainment' consisted of 1 film then American programmes that I've never even heard of then it was turned off altogether 2 hours before we landed!

Had to literally run to the connecting gate due to such a late arrival the gates were very far apart. Plane was filthy. I don't think they clean them ever. Seats are small and uncomfortable. Can't even fully open the tray tables. I'm not a large person and I was unable to do it so I'm sure large people can't use them at all.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Lauren Pasternak,United States,10/8/2014,"Original flight was from LGA to DFW. After flying in circles in the air for half an hour we finally re-routed to land in Little Rock Arkansas. We sat on the runway in the plane for at least two hours with no offerings of good or water even after the 4 hour flight. I understand completely this is weather related and only looking out for our safety however this was not handled well at all. When asking the stewardess for water- it's like it was a huge inconvenience. We finally deboard the plane in Arkansas and were told to wait around to see if the flight is officially cancelled - an hour later it was. Hotel rooms were not offered to be paid for not even a meal or anything at all. Everyone paid out of pocket and waited to de board the next morning. Back at the airport at 6am and we were told to use our old boarding passes and go directly to security- they refused us and made is wait back in the long American Airlines line to get a new boarding pass. My final destination was Austin which was also cancelled. They put me on a flight to Houston in first class which was unexpected. However I decided to just rent a car and drive to Austin from Dallas but I was told that there was no possible way to get my bag because it was listed as priority to Houston. Well our flight from Arkansas to Dallas was delayed an hour then the flight from Dallas to Houston was delayed another hour. First class wasn't anything special honestly more leg room and drinks served in glass instead of plastic. Finally arrive in Houston waiting at baggage claim and guess what - my bag isn't there. I was told it was on the next flight coming in from Dallas which infuriated me after I wanted to originally take my bag in Dallas as it was. Waited around the airport for another hour or so and finally get my bag with a big orange sticker on it saying ""priority"". Yeah right. Never will fly American again.",,,Economy,,1,3,1,1,1,,,3,0

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,A Man,United Kingdom,10/5/2014,Recently flew DUB-ORD - 22 year old 767 ORD-LAX-SFO 737's SFO-LAX-LHR 737 and new 777. Apart from the fact that I got there and back safely I must say what a disappointment the airline is in terms of inflight entertainment comfort staff and food/drinks. I fly regularly from the UK mainly East on EU/Asian airlines or within Europe and I now realise how spoilt we are here. When comparing AA to QR EK etc they just do not compare in any regard. The old 767 aircraft in a very tired state still had analogue buttons for their armrest music entertainment system and huge drop down crt displays. Food was awful and very poor quality on takeoff. The pre-landing snack a deep dish pizza was much better albeit on the greasy side. Domestic US services were on 737's - one with the new sky interior and 2 older interiors. All perfectly fine to get me from point A to B. Plenty of rather expensive food purchase options in the terminals and ability to bring food on board was good. I did not think much of the in- flight food menu for purchase - limited choice and not great quality it would seem. Nice touch for in-flight wi-fi although I didn't use it. The biggest disappointment and a real embarrassment was the supposed 'flagship American service' from LAX-LHR. Super cramped seating in 10 abreast layout in economy meant no elbow room whatsoever. Very poor in-flight entertainment system - hard to navigate difficult to find music titles plus generally limited selection. The catering was shockingly poor for dinner a chicken dish which was flavourless and served with a salad with grated cheese and dressing some crackers with cheese spread a biscuit for dessert and a cold and chewy roll. Breakfast was similarly disappointing and consisted of a yoghurt orange juice and a horrible leathery croissant served with jam and butter. A continental breakfast on a service between the states and the UK? Where is the sausage and eggs? Even Qatar give the above and a hot dish as their breakfast in better quality. The embarrassment really comes with the announcement at the start of the flight where we are introduced and welcomed to their 'flagship' service. It is laughable. On a plus note the drinks service was perfect. Crew were very hit and miss on all sectors. 767 is way above the 777 in terms of comfort and space. I would much rather have 9 abreast in a 777 or a 22 year old 767 then this flagship 777. Good USB/power options though - that's probably the only thing that they got right on AA136.

The planes we flew on with American from the outside looked very modern however once we boarded things were very different. The interiors were outdated and looked like they had been in use since the 70's the interior was dull and the seats were like something out of a scrap yard mine was actually broken from were the trolleys had banged into it coming down the aisles. None of the economy seats had single televisions which I just could not believe for a long haul flight! Only business class are given portable tablets to watch the entertainment. The food was very poor and tasteless and the flight crew were bickering between themselves from take off to landing.

We were on Alaskan Airlines flight powered by American Airlines. They were early to the airport for check-in at Alaska but got directed to go to American Airlines because for some reason we needed to check in there. The Alaskan Airlines employees were very cheerful and eager to help. Then when we showed up to American Airlines we were not even able to check-in even though they had 43 minutes before takeoff. They were 2 minutes late for automated check in. Then they had to wait in another line which gave them another flight which added an extra stop in Dallas. This changed their travel time from 5.5 hrs originally to a 9 hr journey. We had to accept even though we tried to plead them to get them on the original flight. The terrible thing is that they got to their standby gate 15 minutes earlier than the original flight was going to take off.

Old seats but still comfortable. The two First Class flight attendants on this 4 hour leg were fantastic.

Terminal C Admirals Club was a nice rest spot for our 90 minute lay over. MD-80 in First on the short 32 minute trip to Austin.

The attendant in the lounge told me we were lucky we had a plane. After boarding I was told the seat was not operational there was a barely visible sticker. But they did not know to what degree. The pilot had to look it up in his log. This took some 30 minutes. Verdict seat does not recline at all! They moved me to the back an arms reach from the coach bathroom. Each time someone went in and came out door slamming flash of light. There were 2 other much more desirable seats 4 AB it turned out those were for the staff. AA knows this are undesirable seats and it does not book them for their employees. The service on AA compared to other airlines is pitiful. With a few exceptions they treat you like they are doing you a favor. You never see a smile. The food most of the time is just plain bad. Due to the delay I almost missed my connection. After arriving to my final destination I found out that my luggage did not make it they found it 2 days later. Due to having to file paperwork for the missing luggage I missed my connection. AA is trying to blame it on the other airline.,,,Business Class,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,David Iles,United Kingdom,9/17/2014,Miami - Los Angeles. Booked the tickets in advance so the cost of travelling first class for a near 6 hour trip was good value against the price charged for economy. Check in quick and we boarded on time with no delays. The crew were excellent attentive without being intrusive used our names when asking what we would like to drink and all made us all feel welcome on board. The food was very palatable. IFE was limited to drop down screens as the aircraft whilst scheduled to be one of the newer A321s in two class configuration was swapped out for an older 737 still wearing the old AA livery hence the 2 stars for IFE. Overall a very positive experience with AA on this flight.,,,First Class,,10,4,5,4,2,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,John Brewer,United States,9/17/2014,This is my first and last time to fly AA. Booked my vacation 6 months in advanced for Sunday to Sunday in the Dominican Republic. Arrived on Sunday morning to find out AA switched our flight to their sister company US Airways. Went to US airways to check in and they had no record of the switch. Went back to AA and after a search located our reservation. However this took so long that we missed our flight and they didn't have anything else going out on that day. They rebooked us for Monday morning and tried fixing it with $200 voucher (my non refundable room was $300 plus missing a day of vacation). On Monday morning (5.15 am flight) we showed up and checked in and got on the plane it is now 6.15 am and we are still sitting at the gate because an exterior light is out. You would thing they could have fixed it overnight. Anyway no matter how the rest of the flight goes they can't change my mind about the low scores on this review.,,,Economy,,1,1,3,1,1,,,1,0

The new airbus was polished and the cabin smart. I actually got four hours sleep on the new flatbed. Pre drinks meal service and the cookie and milk prior to landing was super nice and very much felt like service on there international routes when AA is on point. I have had nightmare crew on international flights like many reviewers have mentioned but AA really has made a substantial effort to compete on the NYC/LA route.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,D Hansen,United States,9/17/2014,I was scheduled to leave on Thursday at 3:05 PM (august 28 2014). I was called by American and notified that my flight was delayed out of San Diego so my connections would be missed. American then rescheduled me for a flight the following day at 8:30pm (over 29 hours after the departure date I had scheduled). I then called American and got them to put me on the original flight that was delayed and move my connecting flights. My plan was to just sleep in Chicago and fly from Chicago to London and London to Nice the following day. After taking the original delayed flight I got a hotel in Chicago for 200$ because the flight out the next day was not until 5:05pm. 5 hour delay on the flight from Chicago to London - over 2 hours were on-board sitting at the gate. I missed the connection from London to Nice and they put me on another flight which was also delayed 1 hour. I finally arrived in Nice over 24 hours later than the ticket I purchased. On the way back to San Diego everything went smoothly except my luggage did not make one of my connections. I finally got them to deliver the bag 56 hours after I landed.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,2,,,1,0

I was in the very last row (row 32) of an MD-80 - it was noisy back there. My aunt was carrying our babies car seat which had food inside it it dropped into the first class aisle and one of the FA's glared at us and said ""you're dropping food!"" I mean really and she didn't even offer to help carry it? Fortunately a courteous passenger came and helped. Flight Attendant in coach was a lot nicer she even gave us some food for free after she saw how stressed we were. Then the return flight was cancelled because they could not get the hangar door open so American Airlines gave us some Hotel Vouchers. After getting back to the airport American Airlines gave us seats in First Class to make up for the bad night we had free food with larger seats and more legroom was ok but it was just not enough. We were tired and wanted to get home after landing back in Charlotte we had to deal with riding a packed bus to get back to the Long Term parking lot.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,W Coenik,Australia,9/14/2014,Flew with AA on our internal flights in Economy Plus due to one of our team being Gold with Qantas. That little extra leg room makes the difference. They were all short flights of no more than 2 hours so not getting feed was not an issue. Check in was good and service was friendly. We had a 2 hour delay in Miami due to a fuel delivery issue that was affecting most of the airport not just our flight. They keep us well informed. We had to terminate one of our through flights in Chicago on our way to St Louis due to one of our team becoming ill. We went straight to check-in to advise them that we would not be continuing our flight to St Louis and they were unable to stop our bags from going to St Louis. But they did everything they could to return our bags to us. They put them on the first flight back to Chicago and delivered them to our hotel later than night. Great service.

Even when the 767 airplanes they are using on the MIA-MVD route are old beaten down and the business class seating is at the minimum acceptable level the price matches what one can consider a ""budget trip"". However I could smell unpleasant odors from the bathrooms both ways from MVD while seating on row 3 in business class. This may not be acceptable to any business class passenger I must say. Also I verified that bathrooms were not cleaned by the staff. Perhaps some disinfecting towels would do passengers can clean the bathrooms by themselves and help with the smell. Anything but making your stomach revolt when having your dinner or breakfast in business class.

We were surprised to be automatically allocated leg-room seats by an emergency exit at no extra cost. However we were extremely surprised and disappointed to be on a very old plane (still old logo) and had no personal TV screens for a long haul flight! I have never encountered this before. We could also barely see the shared TV screens. Only one film of two was shown. The air hostesses were distracted tired looking and talking amongst themselves for much of the flight. It felt like an internal AA flight. All the same was exactly true for our return flight but furthermore they could not seat us together on our wedding anniversary. If this is how UK Manchester customers are treated (the same surely can't be true flying out of London!) then prices should reflect the poor service.

From KL to Hartford it was okay. On the long parts (KL to Frankfurt Frankfurt to Charlotte) we were given two meals and a snack. The meals were okay but I was disappointed on the snack which was cookies and chocolate. Of course no menu as with Etihad and Qatar. I know I know I chose the airline because of the low price. I was even more disappointed on the trip back. On the flight from Chicago to London the seats and space were so tight we could barely move. The plane looked old and shabby. It still had those communal TV!. Come on! On a 7-hour flight? Those things were so outdated! The flight from Heathrow was much better. It's the new A380. Still food was not much better.

The second leg it was full and it was a hassle before take off with all the carry on bags the crew were asking passengers to collaborate by placing their smaller item under the front seat. This is what it happens when airlines charge for check in bags. You have to purchase the meal on board but the crew with a few smiles serves complimentary non alcoholic drinks. I found it weird when the crew were saying ""We know that you have a choice thank you for choosing us"" during their announcements. I chose American Airlines simply because it offered a lower price despite the long trip I had to do. Overall this airline is not amazing but it's slightly better than some low cost airlines.

After being boarded on that second aircraft we were informed that the ""maintenance log had been removed from the aircraft and not returned as expected"" so we would need to wait until it was located. Initially this appeared to be mere incompetence but swiftly came to seem like subterfuge. Fully an hour later we have just been told there is a panel on our aircraft that has to be replaced. This is supposed to take 1 hour. Meanwhile our original aircraft remains grounded without further explanation. As a passenger I am apprehensive flying on aircraft in such poor repair and moreover feel deceived repeatedly by gate agents and flight crew who are either misinformed themselves or deliberately trying to hide the sorry state of American's fleet.

The food and beverage was quite good for economy. Coming back to the USA was an entirely different story. Flew from DUB-Chicago on an old outdated 767-300 that smelt bad and looked very worn. The carpet was dirty and so was the seats. Additionally it was unacceptable to fly transatlantic with community video screens that appear to be running from a DVD setup with poor picture quality and sound. Again the crew was fantastic and treated my daughter extremely well and was very help with making arrangements to catch our next flight to Dallas even though we arrived over an hour late.

Delay of 45 minutes on the flight to ABQ but AA maintained that the flight will be on time until 15 minutes before the designated departure time although a delay was obvious as there was no plane at the gate so slightly irritating bad communication.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,D Swarts,United States,8/18/2014,This is a general review of American Airlines. Since 2000 I have flown with AA more than any other airline racking up nearly 1 million miles most in Economy some in Economy Plus and some in First Class. Maybe it's because I have so much experience that little things and small delays do not phase me but I have rarely had a problem so bad that I felt the need to contact AA customer service and I've never written a negative review. Yes it would be nice to get a snack with your beverage like Delta gives but I can bring my own package of cookies or peanuts if I want. And yes the MD-80 aircraft does not have inflight entertainment but they've had powerports on MD80s for a long time and then I've got a fully-charged laptop and smart phone to entertain me. Yes I've run into weather delays in Chicago during the winter which is why I connect through Dallas whenever possible. Yes it would be nice if they would upgrade some of their gate areas with more power plugs and offer their gate agents some sort of incentives to be a little nicer with regular passengers and not just us elite passengers. And yes sometimes they want more money for the same route as a competitor and those are the times I book with another carrier. But throughout my near-million miles and 14 years flying AA I still recommend the airline to my friends and family to get them anywhere in the world they need to go safely on time and for a reasonable cost.,,,Economy,,9,4,4,4,1,,,4,1

I got the impression that serving the needs of the passengers was not a priority. I had reported to a flight attendant about some good amount of water sloshing around in the lavatory. It was slippery and the dirty liquid had got on my shoes and clothing. The flight attendant replied that she did not think the liquid was water and was not going to touch it. I do not understand why it could not have been mopped up. I think is was very inappropriate of the Airline to not train their flight attendants in mopping up unpleasant ""spills"" in the lavatories and providing them the sanitary means of doing so. This was upsetting to me to have to use lavatories with unsanitary conditions on an airline! The American Airline website makes it very difficult to send a complaint to.

This was a bit like going from a fine Hotel (Qatar) to a cheap roadside motel (American). The American Business Class lounge/Admirals Club lounge at LHR beyond the new entrance is simply a dump. Old tired furniture no charm or ambience and an almost complete lack of any kind of decent food or snacks. I saw one tureen of dried up pasta and some pretzels and 2-3 halves of white bread sandwiches. Self serve beverages were somewhat limited with cheap brands of alcohol and ""spouts"" on the wine bottles-a really low class touch. Although the roughly half full business does have a state of the art flat bed seat with decent storage the cabin service was dismal. Pre departure beverages were served in flimsy plastic glasses. Cabin staff attitude throughout the flight was casual and usually indifferent. I slept until approx. 1.5 hours before landing missing the snack service. No a single member of the cabin crew offered to serve it to me later. The rear lavatories were devoid of any cosmetics the forward lavatories were stocked. Of course there were no flowers in the lavatories. Catering was adequate the menu was a tiny card like affair nothing like the elegant and extensive menu presented in a folder on Qatar.

Daylight flight from Miami to Sao Paulo - delayed 4 hours and that is where American failed its passengers. They boarded us and at the departure time they asked us to de-board as the plane has mechanical issues. Ok - fine. They say there is a plane at a gate that will take us to SP and they just need to service the plane. That was a lie - all the passengers got to the gate (and we had been told to take our pillows and blankets as the new plane wouldn't have them) and there was no plane. We sat around for 3 hours before a plane showed up from the hanger where 4 AA 777s sat the whole time. Finally board and take off - 8 hour flight and flight attendants were friendly. Seat comfort is awful - no leg room due to entertainment box at the window. Seat cushion is non-existent so luckly the extra pillow helped (we got on the plane and blankets and pillows were already there). Upon landing in Sao Paulo at 12:10am (4 hours late) we finally got an apology from the flight deck - until then they didn't say a thing about the delay. Come on American - have some respect for the people who pay your bills. I did get an email when I landed with an apology and 5000 AA miles - ok - that's nice. But I felt sorry for the many passengers who missed connecting flights at 12.10am there are no more flights until morning. I had a 2.5 hour drive to Santos and didn't get to my hotel until 3am. When AA does it well - its great. When they fail - its really bad.,,,Economy,,7,2,4,3,3,,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,D Graubard,United States,8/13/2014,July 31 - CWB-POA-MIA-ORD. 767-300 from CWB to Miami in Business Class. Flight boarded and crew had just come in from Miami. They were awful - no one said hello or offered a drink until just before we departed 45 minutes late to Porto Alegre. I understand they are tired - AA needs to change crew at Curitiba and have a fresh crew all the way to MIA. Landed 30 min behind schedule at POA - had to exit the plane and they gave us new boarding passes and just waited in the gate area for boarding. Little cafe had snacks and flight was packed (in coach - 1/2 full in Biz) so gate area was busy. POA-MIA - excellent service! Flight attendants were so friendly and accommodating. Greeted you by name - were always in the cabin even though the flight leaves POA at 12:05am - with water and snacks. Slept well and had a quick breakfast before landing in Miami. Aborted landing due to some warning light in the cockpit but did a fly around and landed safely. A really nice flight once we got the new crew at POA. This is the type of service that makes AA stand out.,,,Business Class,,8,5,4,4,4,,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Daniel Thomas,United States,8/13/2014,JFK to LHR. AA's problems are no longer the fleet its old tired flight attendants that should be in bed rather than serving passengers paying up to $6000 for a business class seat with an attitude and a lack of respect that is simply unacceptable. Other passengers complained as well. Just impersonal and rude service on AA104. American needs to ground those FA's that are older and with attitude. Hire younger FA's that want to do their job rather than complaining to passengers about how the airlines have changed and how what we pay for the seats isn't worth it. After 33 years I'm not flying AA anymore. Ill go BA or anything other than an American carrier. They just honestly are awful now and I see no change due to them being union. Fly a foreign carrier. You'll see the difference.,,,Business Class,,3,4,1,2,4,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Sharon Mills,United States,8/13/2014,We flew from Shreveport LA to DFW. We then flew from Dallas to London. Neither plane left on time or got us there on time. We had people waiting in London. Same happened on the way back. On the way back we were shuttled to British Airways. Got to Dallas had a six hour layover. Because British Airways was late getting us to Dallas the layover was five hours. We sat in the airport in Dallas for 4.5 hours at the gate we were supposed to leave from. Twenty minutes before the plane was to leave from Dallas the gate was changed and we had to run to get to the new gate. I have come to the conclusion that American Airlines doesn't care at all about their customers. For the prices people are charged for tickets and fees you would think service would be better. Won't fly American again.,,,Economy,,1,1,3,2,1,,,2,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,N Smith,United States,8/6/2014,My husband and I recently flew American first class from SFO through DFW to SDF. This was a last minute change from a ticket on another airline that allows cancellations without penalty because we found our outbound trip to be somewhat stressful. We are delighted we made the change. The one way fare was very reasonable and the service was superior. The SFO to DFW leg was on a wifi equipped 737. We were in seats 3F and 4F and both of us had plenty of legroom and the seats were very comfortable. Entertainment was Rio 2 which we didn't watch because we were reading (and eating). Breakfast for me was granola fruit salad orange juice coffee and a hot biscuit with jam. I am a southern girl and take pride in my own biscuits and I have to say the AA version was excellent. The other choice was a strata with muffin which my husband also found quite tasty the flight attendant passed the muffin/biscuit basket a couple of times but we were too full to partake. At the end of the flight she stopped by each seat and thanked us for flying American. The DFW to SDF leg was on an A312 which was quiet (a little noisy on takeoff) and sturdy. In flight entertainment choice (personal TV) was excellent - many movies TV and music channels to choose from. The snack was also quite good - I had a salad with poached chicken quinoa asparagus and arugula with a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. Husband had an open-faced turkey/tomato/gruyere sandwich on fresh bread with a macadamia nut cookie. He also had a tumbler of red wine I had a diet Pepsi (they also offer Coke products). The flight attendant was also quite attentive and spoke with us by name. We felt very well taken care of.,,,First Class,,9,4,5,5,4,,,5,1

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Cynthia Robertson,United States,8/6/2014,July 31 we were on flight 3143 NAS to MIA. Flight was scheduled to take off at 605. We were on the runway on time when a passenger became ill. We returned to the terminal. They left her on board until a paramedic arrived to check her out. At this point she felt better and wanted to continue but had to wait until someone from headquarters arrived to determine if it was safe for her to stay on the flight. They took her off the plane then allowed her to return then took her off again. Every person on that plane had a connecting flight to catch. They then had to refuel the plane. We then got back on the runway then had to go back to check out a maintenance issue. We sat there another 30 minutes. Then we had to get off the plane while they worked on it. At 9.30 we boarded again then had to wait for a passenger who couldn't decide whether or not to continue. We finally left NAS at 10 pm. When we landed in MIA we had to go back through customs find our luggage then try to find someone from AA to help us all reschedule flights. No one from AA was available to help us until after 11 pm. They put us up overnight at a local hotel and rescheduled all our flights for the next day but it was a very poorly handled situation. I do not plan to use AA in the future. We have used other airlines many times and have had issues but never anything handled this poorly.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Arnold MacDonald,United States,8/6/2014,I have been an airline passenger for the past 60 years. All types of planes to all types of destinations with all types of carriers. The golden years you might say when the flights were not only comfortable but fun and even riotous at times! The service food and drinks (especially the drinks) were an integral and indispensable part of the experience. It is sad to see what was once a wonderful and exciting experience reduced to the level of a bus ride and a damn uncomfortable bus ride at that! Flight AA121 Paris (CDG) to New York (JFK) July 2nd 2014 gave a glimmer of hope. The cabin crew were experienced co-ordinated pleasant and most helpful.,,,Economy,,5,2,5,2,2,,,4,1

Strangely enough it was a nice and overall experience with AA. B777-300 the cabin looks fresh and airy. The stewards and stewardesses ages were no lower than 50 years but the steward on duty on my aisle was very friendly. Food was ok we had a choice between chicken or pasta (no menu distributed) and an hour before arrival they distributed hot pizza and in between several rounds of drinks. Flight departed on time and arrived in JFK almost right on time. Overall experience was better than expected and I'll fly them again!,,,Economy,,9,4,4,3,3,,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,V Bragg,Switzerland,8/3/2014,"We paid for 6 business class tickets from Zurich via London to Dallas. Then 4 business class tickets from Los Angeles to London to Zurich. I've never seen a more consistent disgruntled group of employees in all of the years I've flown overseas. Where to begin? We chose American because of the ""New"" business class. We were given an old plane. My family is very low maintenance. We only ask for simple respect. We are mid flight and AA cancels our connection from Dallas to Grand Junction. 10 hours before we are to board. We don't get the notification until we reach our gate to fly to Grand Junction. No effort on AA part at all to help us. No hotel no car service. We make our own arrangements. This may seem small but by this point we are exhausted. Any help at all by AA would have been appreciated. Our return trip. I went for more water I was told they only had the large bottles. If I wanted more water I could bring my small empty water bottle up and refill it. Not how can I help you? Not can I bring the water to you? They stand there chatting while I try to refill my bottle.",,,Business Class,,1,2,1,2,4,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,R Paterson,United States,8/2/2014,JFK-LAX return in F on the new A321 transcon product. American has really upped their game here. The hard product is outstanding in terms of privacy comfort and durability. Feels very exclusive and closer to the luxury that Asian and some European carriers are offering in long haul configurations. Outbound check-in was prompt although not very helpful with navigating the chaos that was security at JFK T8. Onboard service was exceedingly professional albeit not intrusive but that's the way I like it. Purser kept a watchful eye on the 10 pax in the cabin and was very prompt with drink refills or any other needs. Food was above expectations and in fact quite tasty. Could have a better champagne for first class (it is in fact not a real champagne but a domestic sparkling wine) but that's a first world problem of course. Pillow and blanket provided were of good quality could use a mattress pad for overnight flights. On the return check in at LAX Flagship was quick and friendly brought to the front of the security line which was nice. Can't comment on onboard service on the return because once we hit 10000 feet I put the seat into bed mode and slept a complete four and a half hours of solid sleep waking just before descent. This is a first for me in over 25 years of travel. For that reason alone I fully commend this product. It's a game changer for the NY-LA market.,,,First Class,,10,4,4,3,3,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Mark Elliott,Australia,8/2/2014,I recently flew with AA and US Airways from New York Boston and Washington DC. I cannot believe that American Airlines is part of the One World Alliance. When you look at the level of service you get from world class airlines like Qantas Cathay Pacific and LAN and then see the pathetic offering you get from AA I am dumbstruck. As a frequent Australian traveller I absolutely hate having to use AA anytime. Their Admirals Club lounges are truly pathetic - paying for food and pseudo-snacks like pretzels and plastic wrapped muffins. AA passengers who fly Qantas and use the Qantas Club lounges must be amazed. The service on AA is uniformly awful and rude. How can Americans put up with such an array of shocking airline companies. Now that AA have bought US Airways it will be doubly bad.,,,Economy,,1,2,1,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,C Bundick,United States,8/2/2014,My flight out of Chicago was delayed for hours and then cancelled at 1am. Understandable taking into consideration Chicago weather. However it was the customer service received during and after this that convinced me to end my days as an American Airlines flyer. I spent the next few hours on hold with customer service trying to get my flight rebooked. After 3.5 hours on hold I booked a flight for the following morning through the AA website to ensure that I would return home on time. The next morning unable once again to contact customer service I boarded the flight and made it home in time to return to work. Only after I finally contacted customer service did I learn that I had in fact been booked on a rescheduled flight. I searched my inbox spam and trash but had received no sort of email or notification of the rescheduling. If I had been informed of this flight or been able to contact customer service I could have foregone the cost of a second flight and avoided all of the frustrating cold emails that have taken place since.,,,Economy,,1,2,1,2,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,John Parsons,United States,7/31/2014,DFW to PDX - the service was terrible. First the price: it was $360 round-trip non-stop. While this may sound like a good deal it was not too long ago that American wanted $500 for the same trip. I could go to Europe one- way for that! The price drop is the only reason why I give them 2 out of 5 stars for value. If it weren't for that I would give them one-star without a second thought. Second the lines for baggage check were long. Apparently this airline does not realize that it's 2014: I was completely unable to pay my baggage fee online and there was no fast check-in option either. So I had to wait in line to do something I could have done online with other air carriers and only takes five minutes at most with other ones. Third the seats. They were harder than rocks with virtually no leg room with my messenger bag below the seat in front of me. It was virtually impossible to sleep or rest in my seat. When I got off the plane I was very sore. The flight attendants did not care about my experience and the check-in agents flat out ignored me at PDX. Lastly when I emailed American with a complaint about these issues I got the most sarcastic response I have ever got from a customer service representative. In conclusion I never plan on flying American again. I'd rather have a stop (or two!) than fly them.,,,Economy,,2,1,2,1,1,,,2,0

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,R Kanefsky,United States,7/29/2014,"Let me start by saying I am a regular business flier and travel frequently although because of issues like the following complaint usually only fly AA as a last resort. On a recent trip from LGA to DFW AA forced me to gate- check my same standard 22in. carry-on bag which I take on every flight on every other airline. The bag clearly fit within the test box when I had to test it the first time going through the security checkpoint and similarly fit again when forced to test it at the gate but because the agent said I had to ""push"" it down to fit within the box it was too big and had to be checked. When I boarded the plane I was frustrated to see that the bag would have easily fit within the overhead compartment. Maybe AA has smaller jets with smaller overhear storage capacity than every other major airline. This was a big inconvenience and was easily avoidable and I will continue to avoid flying on AA whenever possible.",,,Economy,,2,3,1,3,1,,,3,0

There was no more flights from DFW to TYR afterwards. The assistant checked us in for the 9.00 flight the next day. When we requested whether there was a voucher for a hotel we were told no. We called the customer service and were blamed for not listening to the announcements. We had to rent a car to return home and drove back to DFW next day to return the rental car.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Mitchell Norman,United Kingdom,7/27/2014,LHR-MIA-LHR. It is some time since I have flown AA transatlantic after many years of having previously done so when both the hard and soft products were truly appalling. This choice came about as a result of the fare being two-thirds of the next best so difficult to ignore. Both sectors were by B77W equipment with the new Business Class configuration. This is a vast improvement. The cabin crew actually seemed to enjoy being there (almost) although the sole male cabin crew member in Business on the return flight was extremely obnoxious. Food was ok- ish and whilst I had chosen my entrees on-line for both sectors there was no record on board of any of my selections. The cabin crew told me that this on-line facility was a complete waste of time as it never worked. Overall AA was better than my recollection of many years before but hard product apart it continues to be still a long way behind the alternatives.,,,Business Class,,7,4,3,3,3,,,4,1

Had no reasonable explanation other than they are re-figuring their planes! Really messed up our departure for sure. The planes are so old and dirty. Couldn't even use the bathroom as it was filthy on our last flight. The attendants were miserable! TV monitors were from the dark ages not to mention the inside condition of the plane.

I have been flying these sectors along with other Latin routes with (Latin) American Airlines which bears little resemblance to AA mainline for some 25 years on the same aircraft type with the same take-it or leave-it cabin crew attitudes.

In addition the staff were at best terse at worst indifferent. I can only believe they are as fed up as I was being stuck on that aircraft. On the bright side it arrived on time overall however it was a prime example of a truly budget flight the only thing is I paid a lot of money for the flight.

They changed my flight to US Air but didn't inform me until one week before flight. I paid for upgrade seats but it was not transferred over. Now what really bother me was my return trip home from New Orleans well I didn't get back until a day later. Both airlines seemed to simply want to place blame on each other when they should be working together on rescheduling flights when they cancel them. American whom I booked with originally were of absolutely no use to me once they changed me to a US Air flight. Though it took many back and forth trips between the two companies finally a supervisor with US Air provided me with some assistance in getting me booked on another flight to fly out a day later. It's ridiculous that it would take me 4 hours in the airport to get rescheduled when I checked in well in advance (4hours) after my flight was canceled. I should not have needed a supervisor to get my flight rescheduled all agents should be able to do it. I went through 5 agents between AA and US Air and none were helpful.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Deborah Yang,United States,7/20/2014,Took AA on a trip to Spain. En route two of my three flights were delayed almost causing me to miss a connection and my baggage was lost - not sure if by American or one of the affiliated carriers. The worst was yet to come however. My flight from Madrid to NYC was delayed by a couple hours and so I was rebooked for my connecting flight. I wish I'd insisted on catching it since it was delayed anyway because what transpired after was unbelievable. The rebooked flight to DC was eventually canceled. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours as maintenance repaired a broken chair then a door and then we lost our slot in the queue and had to wait awhile and then my home airport suspended flights coming and going due to weather. Finally the pilot took us back to the gate and told us our flight was canceled. 4 hours on the tarmac that day. Service to rebook flights was slow and some agents were a bit snippy. Slept at the gate overnight for my early flight the next morning. Had a bad feeling when I saw people arriving through the same gate 15 minutes prior to our scheduled boarding time. Sure enough we sat there for well over an hour as the tyre on the plane was being changed and then the flight was canceled. Exasperated I asked for a flight out of LaGuardia instead and although it was delayed on the runway I eventually got home after four bookings from NYC to DC. Very tight seat arrangement on the planes flying back (because they were older). Food wasn't bad and service on all the planes was overall pretty good. Service at the gate ranged from very solicitous to brusque. The airline seems to schedule flights too close together. On top of that the planes on my return trip were all old and shoddy hence the delays. So I ended up being booked for eight flights round trip when I was originally scheduled for just five. Seven of eight were delayed and two of those led to cancellations. American didn't do much to compensate me for the inconvenience either. I will never fly AA again.,,,Economy,,1,1,3,4,1,,,1,0

Boarding: for all US-bound flights they had to search all our hand-carry bags for water/liquids and they do it in the middle of the bridge where the air isn't moving very well and warm. I don't understand why can't they do it right before scanning the boarding pass. The bridge area is small not a smart idea at all. I feel bad for those in a long line for the economy class.

The overall seat was superior to anyone else's business class I have been on. The food and beverage service was excellent. Appetizing decent portions well served and proper temperature. Inflight entertainment options are excellent. Beats the angled ""lie flat"" seat on the 767's and older triple 7's. You got it right this time.

Ex LAX boarded on time but then due to weather in DFW were delayed for roughly 2 hours. Informed of delay by Captain and given updates. Once underway beverage service given inflight video shown. Overnight in DFW then to OMA next day. Flight delayed due to mechanical issues. Passengers allowed off plane after first hour cabin crew offered juice and water then granola bars. Flight cancelled after 4 hours. $12 refreshment vouchers given. Replacement aircraft and eventually got away about 5.5 hours late. Whilst this was an inconvenience I believe the staff acted properly keeping passengers informed and making alternate arrangements. Return flight I requested baggage to be checked through to SYD which took some time to organise due to booking problems caused by the earlier delay when I had been taken off the delayed flights but then reinstated. Only complaint was during this time our pre-assigned seats were given away and we were given seats at the back of the aircraft without the additional leg room. All things considered I was happier to have bags checked through and less legroom. I have been critical of AA in the past but thus trip they receive full marks.,,,Economy,,7,5,5,3,1,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,B Gentry,United States,7/13/2014,I had not flown AA for a few years and now I know why. AA employees sat in first class on a very early flight from TPA-MIA and spoke loudly to one another while the other first class passengers tried to sleep. Had a 7.40pm flight from MIA-TPA but paid a $75 plane change fee to take the 5.50pm flight. No problem there except for the fact that the plane flight 986 from STT-MIA had an alarm mishap and they had to call a maintenance personnel from off-site. He was very late so therefore missed the earlier connection at 5.50pm from MIA-TPA and took my original flight at 7.40pm-no compensation returned for their error. Other members in my party had first class on the 5.50pm flight and did not receive it when we were all booked on the 7.40pm flight. They did attempt to put us all together but placed us in the exit row with two children traveling under the age of 15. Therefore the kids had to sit in other areas in the plane and were scared to sit alone. Upon a later arrival to TPA at 8.40pm AA/US AIR misplaced our luggage and was it was all still sitting in Miami with Priority tags on them. So much for priority as they turned up a day and a half later.,,,First Class,,1,4,2,1,1,,,1,0

Both flights on old aircraft in particular the flight from Miami to Paris was dreadful on an old 767. No AVOD or individual screen. The seats were the most uncomfortable I have experienced.

I keep seeing a huge increase in great attitudes from flight attendants on AA flights. Very personable and fun on both flights. Departed ORD on-time and landed at JFK early - but taxied around JFK for 30 minutes before getting to our gate. Dinner served was pre-ordered on aa.com and the chicken was very tasty. Return to ORD from LGA - plane was only 60% full and the three flight attendants (DCA-based) were having a great time with everyone. Lots of talking laughing with passengers and very personable. Good dinner served and landed 40 minutes early into ORD. I see a lot of negative reports for AA but I wonder if people are just expecting too much or are exaggerating their issues.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Pam Gould,United States,7/8/2014,One month travel itinerary June 10 - July 8. Point here is not as much about inconvenience as how situations are handled. 4 flights cancelled. One due to weather. Paid upgrades are not refunded if flights cancelled per AA reservations. After 3.5 hour wait little or no information given to waiting passengers in cancellation of first leg OGG-LAX. Restaurant employees saw flight crew leave airport. AA would only help passengers with connections. The rest of us scrambled for flights. Locating luggage was a whole other mishap. 2.5 hr flight from QRO-DFW turned into a 10 hour flight touching down in 2 cities to refuel. Water was being rationed. Children first. No food. No offers from ground crews for additional water or even peanuts. No help with connecting flights. No enough cots in airport Terribly mishandled. Connecting flight missed but cancelled anyway. MCI-OGG delayed 4 hours. Equipment not available. Automated message via phone at 2.30 am for 7.30 am flight. Was auto rebooked on flight out a day later. Called and obtained same day departure. Hoping I get out. Remember when flying used to be fun and airlines treated us with courtesy?

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,J Reed,United States,7/8/2014,"I flew from Ontario CA to Indianapolis IN by way of Dallas TX (round-trip). All 4 planes were MD-80's - I probably don't need to say much more. These planes should have been taken out of service 10 years ago. I was flying them in the early 90's from ORD to LAX they needed to be retired back then. All 4 flights were delayed because of mechanical problems (ranging from inoperative toilets to loose electrical panels). All 4 planes were filthy - not just the rest rooms and aisles - but the seats windows and tray tables were disgusting. All 4 flights were full - so as we sat on the planes waiting for the ""maintenance issues"" to be resolved we roasted. Given that I had a similar experience on a trip from Palm Springs to Cleveland (round trip 4 flight segments) in April on American I should have known better. But as a ""loyal rewards member"" I booked this last flight on American too - hoping for better equipment and on time service. At this point I don't even expect any aspect of comfort on American flights - I just want a safe plane that lands reasonably on time. Given the last 8 flights that I flew on American planes in the last 90 days I'm not even certain that the old MD-80's are safe anymore. When 6 out of 8 of my flights were delayed for mechanical or maintenance issues I begin to wonder I'm going to start building my miles on United. I'm done with American. P.S. - during the last 20 years I have been ""Gold"" ""Platinum"" and in the ""Concierge Key"" program - so I have witnessed the decline of this airline's quality and on- time performance first-hand.",,,Economy,,1,1,2,2,1,,,2,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,W Burg,United States,7/8/2014,Flight #7943 from Honolulu to Los Angeles April 25 2014. This airline is terrible. The only reason to choose this airline is that they have so many flights to so many locations. But it is as if they don't like to be in flight service. Both my husband and I have been regular flight passengers for most of our adult lives for business and pleasure. Over the years AA has not improved on any level of their service. Since going online for booking we have yet to have reservation that isn't botched in some way. I am sitting on AA plane as I write this as we wait after flying 5.5 hours for a gate to become available. Though this may be an airport error the connections between flights is so short that many passengers are in threat of missing there next flight. We almost missed our connecting to this flight because only 30 minutes was allotted between flights.

Flight out of Moline Il was delayed for an hour because the airplane wasn't there.

The cabin was very claustrophobic. There was a big wall in front. The quality and the quantity of the food was pathetic. Inedible unless you were real hungry.

I have recently had a knee replacement so we rented a hotel for the park and fly program as did our daughter's family for a total of $475 so there would be no chance of us being late for our plane which was to leave at 10.35 am. We arrived early as were told to do. Eventually we found that there was a delay of at least 30 minutes. The delay continued to be extended and ended up being a 9 hour wait. AA reps told us there was nothing they could do. The seats are firm plastic with no head rest or place to lean against the wall. We were given a lunch voucher which we used but were never offered a dinner voucher. We became more and more frustrated as time progressed. We finally left for a long flight to Maui with a crew who were unhappy to called out on Father's Day on an unexpected flight. Their attitude reflected that. We were not given anything to compensate for all our problems no free drinks no food. Nothing. We got to our hotel at 3.30 am. On our trip home we were held up because someone had thrown up in the seat but it wasn't cleaned up by the cleaning crew. There was vomit on the seats and in the buckle making it necessary to take off all seat covering and taking out and putting in all new seatbelt apparatus.

I flew from Manaus to Miami overnight and could not get comfortable in the nasty thin under padded seats. The meal service was a soggy ham sandwich and a glutinous dessert while the entertainment was provided by screens that dropped down from the ceilings. Even small Air Canada planes have seat back TVs but American's 737s do not and this on a 5-hour flight. When they dimmed the cabin lights the screens kept playing the film so good luck trying to get any sleep with the flashing lights in your eyes. Awful just awful.

The morning of the flight at about 6.30am (while I was headed to the airport) I was called by American Airlines and it was an automated voice recording telling me that my flight had been cancelled and they automatically put me on a 6.30pm flight that night. I had no option to talk to anyone or hear a reasoning on the scenario that was taking place. I had to call back and go through various automated conversations until I finally reached someone. After explaining the situation (and no sympathy was shown) I realized the person could not help me and did not desire to help me. Little did she know I had major wedding events to get to at my destination (hints why I booked an early flight in the first place). I ended up having to book another flight through Southwest Airlines last minute (costing me a fortune) just to make it to the city in time. It was an all around awful experience dealing with an impersonal system that left me without answers paying a fortune and still arriving later than I planned.

Route ended up being Nashville to Dallas to Las Vegas and vice versa. Our flight was changed several times by the airline before departure date. On the date of departure we received an automated phone call 3 hours before take off notifying us that our plane was delayed 4 hours. This interfered with our connecting flight and there was not another flight that would have us reaching our destination until the next day. I contacted the airline immediately and they confirmed that if they re-routed us we could reach our destination. We agreed to this and proceeded to the airport. Upon arrival we were unable to check in. An hour later it was discovered that when re-routing us the person had neglected to issue us a ticket and now our flight was over booked. Our only option was to drive 2.5 hours to another airport catch a flight there and then have 15 minutes between connecting flights that we were to try and get to the gate and board in time. Somehow we managed to make it and made it to our destination. On our return trip we again couldn't check in and had to see an attendant. Everyone we encountered was extremely rude and hateful.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,A Mather,United Kingdom,6/23/2014,If you're looking for a company that will fly you in the least comfort at the highest price then look no further – you found it. It is inconceivable that American Airlines are still flying old planes with no individual entertainment systems on their transatlantic crossing and charging more than anyone else for the privilege. They didn't even show the film they advertised. We only flew from JFK to Buffalo (with a rival company) a flight of just over an hour and they had individual entertainment screens. To add insult to injury AA ran an ad telling us all how they are adding a new plane every week to their fleet!

I read a lot of complaints about American but it is an American airline serving American tastes. It has no desire to compete with the significantly better Asian and Mid East airlines and it would seem quite happy with its 3-star rating. So don't expect too much! Main cabin extra is excellent and as my husband is a permanent gold card holder we were able to select these at no extra cost. The seats are wider and very comfortable. The extra legroom is a bonus. Everything else is as in economy. The IFE on the -300 is very swish with a large screen and huge content a marked improvement over the -200 and the 767. I've always found that if you are nice to the staff they are nice in return and this was the case on this flight. The service was prompt and efficient the food acceptable and staff were present throughout the flight. Take off and landing were about on time.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Walker Roy,United States,6/20/2014,I booked a flight from LAX to Raleigh-Durham NC. 24 hours before the flight I went on the AA web site to 'Check- in' and obtain my 'Boarding Pass'. When I selected the option to check-in I was asked if I wanted to select a seat. I elected yes and was presented which several options for only 'Paid Seats' at $86/per seat. Thinking there were no other options I selected a seat and paid the $86 for both the departing and return trips. After making and paying $172 for seats the web site asked if I wanted my boarding pass. I said yes and I was offered the option for seat selections that required no extra fee. Feeling set-up wondering why I was not offered options for all available seats from the beginning I called the AA Customer service group and the agent informed me that they could not do anything about changing my seat to one that did not require an extra fee. I then wrote them to ask why I was lead into believing I could only purchase a seat when free seats were available they simply said 'you made the decision to purchase the seat and therefore there is nothing that can do'. After this frustrating experience on the outbound flight I requested a 'bloody mary mix' just after the stewardess handed one to the stewardess covering the first class group. I was informed that they no longer had any more. Things on the return flight were equally as bad. I was unable to print a boarding pass - web message said my reservation had been cancelled. When I attempted to call the customer service group at 11.00 pm EDT the auto attendant informed me that wait time to talk with an agent was 35 minutes.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Williams Mark,United Kingdom,6/20/2014,MIA-LHR 16 June 777-200. Used miles to upgrade from economy. Call centre staff very helpful with this. Our flight didn't have enough upgrades available for both of us but she checked the next flight and found two. We paid a small extra charge to change flights in addition to the usual miles and co-pay but well worth it. We were originally returning on the -300 so a bit disappointed. The 2-3-2 configuration is now old hat as are the seats. American made a big mistake not going for fully flat bed seats when they bought the -200 and the angle flat seats are very out of date. Having said that they were very comfortable with huge legroom. The angle is not as bad as some I've been on though and I managed several hours sleep overnight. Lots of space and a bit of room for your bits and pieces. Service was rushed on takeoff which I assume was because the flight left at 21.20 and they wanted to allow everyone to sleep as soon as possible. Lights were out before we asked for coffee and cognac but staff willing to continue serving us as long as were wanted. Staff were visible all night as far as I could see. Be nice to the staff and they will usually be nice to you. Almost always works as it did on this flight. Food was only average certainly not what I expect for business class - grossly overcooked steak destroyed broccoli thing and something else I couldn't identify. Breakfast was a lovely omelette but it came with another grossly overcooked and dry bit of steak. It was all well presented and served however with good crockery flatware and glass wine glasses. Interesting that they did trolley service rather than tray service I have previously had on American. IFE on the -200 is dated with a reasonable screen size but limited selection of movies. It broke down at the beginning of the flight and it took a very long reboot to get it going. Certainly not up to the standard on the -300. Bose noise-reducing headphones a great idea but they are collected an hour before landing. The map feature showing flight progress etc didn't work for the entire flight. American is not trying to be one of the significantly better Asian or Mid East airlines so don't expect it to be. Keep expectations reasonable and you will likely enjoy the flight. I did.,,,Business Class,,8,4,4,3,2,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,P Miller,United Kingdom,6/17/2014,LAX-LHR. Business check-in at American's terminal at LAX is a joke. 1 person to check in everyone while 2 customer service agents hang around telling us 'they're going as fast as they can'. Security was in a tiny airless room - I couldn't quite believe this was the entrance to the terminal. Once through we passed the main spacious security check-in - it was closed. At the Admirals Club things started to look up: it's large with friendly bartenders and table service for drinks. Surprised to be restricted to 2 drinks coupons though. I'm guessing it's because there are domestic passengers in the lounge too. The plane was at a remote stand so we had to take a bus out to it - this surprises me as you would have thought that LAX-LHR was a premium route and American would want to encourage passengers. On board the cabin in business class on the 777-300 is exceptional - probably best across the Atlantic. Huge seats comfy flat bed great IFE plenty of drinks and ok food. Cabin crew friendly enough. Easy to sleep on this plane. There was a delay due to a sick passenger on the incoming flight and then a minor maintenance issue - all the movies were on so we drank and watched films. Breakfast was plentiful and really fresh. Sorry to get off at LHR!,,,Business Class,,9,5,4,4,5,,,5,1

The second flight from Dallas to El Paso was delayed for an hour at El Paso where we sat on the tarmac for an hour in temperatures of c.110F because of a failed air conditioning unit. Offered not so much as a glass of water. The delay meant that the car hire desk we were using was closed at El Paso. The second internal flight was from El Paso to Phoenix. This time the flight was delayed because the 'pontoon bridge' attaching the plane to the terminal was broken. Again we sat on the tarmac without refreshment. Again surly and uncooperative staff. We were sat at the back of the plane when drinks were finally offered there was very little choice left and no time to enjoy them. The third flight from Las Vegas to New York was relatively uneventful tho' with ungracious and charmless grumpy staff. The food on board was expensive terrible and tasteless. The final flight was delayed more than 2 hours at take off and just under two hours at landing. No staff would tell us what was going on the plane was changed and we were forced to split up our family seats and had to sit in different places on the plane. The food was inedible. Staff were not only surly but extremely rude.

From the start the aircraft was very dated and did not smell particularly clean. The food was dull unappetising and almost thrown at you by the staff drinks were not offered except with the meal I had to beg a member of staff for a bottle of water on the journey. The IFE was very poor the TV was attached to the ceiling above the aisle so from my window seat I couldn't see the full screen so didn't get any IFE. On the return journey the same 4 episodes of ""Salvage Hunters"" was shown on a loop so repeated 3 times during the 7 hour flight. The seats were uncomfortable and very cramped on the return flight the passenger in front had his seat back which meant for a very claustrophobic journey. The most startling aspect to flying with American Airlines was the rudeness of the staff! I went to the toilet and an exiting a member of staff had started serving lunch she kept shouting at me to not stand close to her (which I was not) and in the end marched me to my seat and demanded I ""sit now"". On the return I had to plead for a drink only to get a very aggressive member of staff thrust a can of juice at me before saying ""now go sit down"".

The trip out: went online to get boarding passes had to choose my seats (two flights). I chose my seat for the first flight no problem. Chose my seat for the second flight: $28 later I had both boarding passes. Silly me I expected when I bought my ticket that I would have a seat without paying extra not so I was in a so called ""upgrade"" seat which I didn't ask for nor did I want but that was all that was left. I did not get anything extra for having paid for a so called ""upgraded"" seat. I had to do the same thing on the return trip. Also you have to pay for your luggage. On the return trip I purchased a sandwich for $9.99 which was most definitely the worst sandwich I have ever had. I will fly Southwest when in need of a flight you purchase a fare from them you not only have a seat that you don't have to pay extra for your first bag is free.",,,Economy,,5,1,3,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,K Noonan,United States,6/5/2014,I normally fly Southwest exclusively - so you can imagine the culture shock when I found myself booked (by my company) on an American flight from SFO to JFK. The only thing I can say positively is that the food was really fantastic quite unexpected for in-flight cuisine. The drinks also came very consistently. The crew were not unpleasant but not quite up to the standards of the Southwest culture. And for a completely redesigned seat the Business Class seat was the most uncomfortable thing I have endured. I am 5'1 so my feet never touched the floor. I tried every adjustment on the panel but nothing worked. Finally I just used my provided pillow to stuff behind me to make my feet touch the floor. Between that and the leg rest I was able to get a little sleep on the way home. There was no indication of how to use the video screen in front of me or any explanation of how to operate the headphone (where the jack was located etc.) or anything. I stopped flying American about 12 years ago and now I remember why.,,,Business Class,,3,1,3,5,1,,,3,0

The seats on AA far more comfortable than on BA greater privacy with 1-2-1 configuration free access without having to step over the neighboring passenger plus all seats facing forward something I never liked on BA set up with window seats facing backward. Inflight entertainment beats BA in every respect screens double the size appeared to be HD greater choice of movies. Food was delicious well presented good choice of wines.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M Comfort,United States,6/4/2014,LAX to Phoenix. We were really unhappy with the customer service of American Airlines employees at LAX. We had a flight coming into LAX run really late and were bumped to a later flight the next day. We arrived to the airport at 8.00 and our flight to Phoenix was departing at 9.25. I usually arrive to airports about 1.5 hours before a domestic flight and this is usually plenty of time. We checked in at the kiosk but the computer would not print the bag tags. We grabbed an airline employee who directed us to a baggage check line for others with issues with the printing. It was only four people deep so we were not too worried. After about 20 minutes and the line had barely moved we started to become nervous. We tried talking to a couple agents about taking our bags from us and sticking them on a later flight so we could still make it to our gate. They were all at the most apathetic and kept telling us there was nothing they could do. By the time we finally got to the counter we had been in line 45 minutes. There were two employees working this whole time even though the process seemed to be incredibly slow. This inefficient system and lacking customer service caused us to miss our flight. Maybe I would think this was normal airline behavior but we have flown with Alaskan airlines in LAX when a connecting flight caused us to come in late. Their employees were very helpful took our bags and sent them on a later flight and even pushed us through security to ensure we made the plane. In the end I will never chose American again if I can help it.,,,Economy,,1,2,1,3,2,,,2,0

It started with a mechanical problem with the plane's intercom which they spent 2 hours trying to fix before looking for another plane. Another plane found boarded and headed to the runway around 7pm. We waited on the runway for 1.5 hours because of ""weather"" (even though other flights on the same route were taking off) then told we had to go back to the gate. One flight attendant then got into a screaming match with a passenger (extremely unprofessional) while I waited with an upset baby for 15 minutes in the roasting hot gangway because they couldn't find anyone to bring up the gate-checked strollers. Finally the ""weather"" was okay to allow us to leave but a new crew was needed we finally left around 11.30pm. And then because LGA was closed it landed at JFK instead.

In April 14 I travelled with American from Miami to Washington DC and their awful check in staff caused my group to miss our flight. There was a cut off check-in time of 9.13am and we arrived about 8.55am and were told not to go the counter but to use self- check-in. We did this and when it came to finalising the check-in the system cancelled our check-in. Again we went to the oh-so-friendly staff which said go to the counter as it will be quick and there is not queue. Went to the counter and by the time we had got through the queue we were 3 mins past our check-in time. The staff couldn't have carried less and just flat out refused to help even thigh it was their fault. We were told that we needed to book in 2hrs before the flight but not only was this not listed on our ticket but our pre-printed boarding passes had 9.13am.

Flight boarded quickly and pilot apologized for the delay. Flight attendants in economy were really great - friendly and prompt to respond to requests. Breakfast was french toast and there was a lot of food provided - I was surprised as usually breakfasts on AA Int'l are small. 2 movies shown on the overhead monitors - this is where AA fails without excuse. These planes need AVOD in each seat - end of story - period. But the service made up for it. Left Chicago 45 min late - arrived London 15 min late.

After reading about the new business class cabin on American's 777-300 we decided to book our trip with them. We made a great choice. At Heathrow there is a separate 'flagship check in' outside the main terminal which was quick calm and very quiet. The Admiral's Club at LHR is disappointing - more like a cafe/canteen with strip lighting. Anyway once on board the cabin was great - the seats are a winner with a real feeling of privacy the screen is huge and there's a big choice of films and the food was good. Crew warmed up after a while and responded well to all requests. The walk-up bar had loads of snacks and was topped up throughout. Flight was on time.

Unpleasant main dish and Breakfast service so rushed that it felt as if it was coach.

The dinner chicken tasted awful. The service from the cabin staff was abrupt and short. Some hand wipes at meal times would be great as the toilets left much to be desired. Also at meal times they would not remind passengers to put their chairbacks up like the attendants on the other airlines I mostly use.

Then after 30 min on the call I talked to them for rebooking. Nothing available. I got someone at a kiosk to help and they booked me on a flight 2 DAYS later whereas I had to be at a conference the next morning. Needless to say that was not an option. I rented a car and drove 10 hours straight to my destination getting to my destination at 4am. Then it is time to get back home and they tell me they have canceled my return ticket because I did not complete my trip. No warning no notification nothing. Just cancelled. So I had to pay for another ticket to get back home. There were many people like me on that plane. People from across the world who couldn't even speak English and they were lost and confused. I ended up helping one of them. There is no excuse for this. This is the worst none customer service oriented company I have ever dealt with.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,S Metrie,Canada,5/20/2014,"We flew Toronto to Chicago; paid almost $700 per ticket which was very expensive considering it was an 1.5 hour flight. When we booked the flight we thought it was through WestJet as it was advertised that way but in small writing at the bottom it said operated by American Airlines which we didn't see when we booked the flight otherwise we wouldn't have booked it. We had a very bad experience with AA a few years ago and refused to book any more flights with them. This time both flights were delayed. When returning they had oversold so my sister and I volunteered to take a later flight. That wasn't the issue. The issue was the incompetence of the staff; it took them an hour and a half to figure out how to give us our vouchers which is ridiculous because they told us we couldn't leave the gate until they gave us the voucher so we couldn't even go and have dinner or anything. On top of that the rep there kept saying she had no idea what she was doing and this was her first time doing vouchers - then get someone who knows what they're doing rather than wasting an hour just trying to figure it out yourself doesn't give us a lot of confidence in your abilities. Other issue was that they kept changing the gate to the flight (it was changed 4 times no exaggeration) and when we would go up to the desk to make sure it was there every person at the desk was extremely rude and one actually said to us ""can't you read the monitor?"" and when we explained that our ticket had a different number than what was on the monitor they gave us a dirty look and said that what they had was right (it wasn't in the end which is pathetic). it would be nice that if you were going to change the gates; at least inform people and let them know. Another minor thing was with the flight attendant she was grabbing something from the bin above my sister and her bag kept hitting my sister's head several times; and she wouldn't even apologize even though she saw it happening; she just gave us a look like how dare you sit there and be in my way when she was the one who was in our way.

There 2 American Airlines Rep working the counters needless to say they were very rude and short. They acted as if they were the one with the problem. They acted as if they did not care if the passengers found a connecting flight or not. I stood in line from approx 1:30 pm to 4:15pm well over 2 hours. Each Rep spent an average of 20 to 30 minutes per customer. At 4:15 2 more Reps appeared from the back however they did not have a clue what they were doing. The first guy told me that all Dallas flights were full and there was nothing available until the next morning and when I arrived in Dallas they would arrange for a hotel for the night. The person in line behind me; also going to Vegas was assisted by a different Rep who manage to find a flight for her and her 3 children.

It seemed that their computers must have shut down because the line wasn't moving. It took us two hours to get checked-in and check our bags. We would have been late for our flight but it was delayed anyway. The delay was over an hour and once we did get on the flight the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. Our delayed flight caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connecting flight- which ended up leaving 10 minutes early (I am not making this up)- meaning we missed it. They issued us tickets for the next flight 3 hours later. We had confirmed seats on the ticket and everything but when we went to board the plane our tickets got flagged as invalid and we were told by the attendant that we were actually in standby- the plane ended up being full and we were not allowed on. So at this point my wife (7 months pregnant) is about to lose it and they tell us we can possibly fly out at 9 PM that evening. We do make that flight and arrive at our destination at midnight missing our evening plans and exhausting us. Again the flight itself was awful.

He advises us that we can fly but our luggage cannot. Only option is to take a flight the next day pay $120 to change the flight and pay for another night in a hotel. The main issue here is the rude attitude of the staff. We can accept that there are rules to be followed but the attitude of the staff is a disgrace.

This is a desperately poor airline but there isn't much choice across the pond sadly. Avoid this carrier if you can.",,,First Class,,1,3,1,1,3,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,J Van Der Merwe,United Kingdom,5/11/2014,We took this airline from Raleigh to London because we expected a similar service to BA with which it codeshares. Unfortunately we were so wrong! There is firstly no modern inflight entertainment system for economy class and the food was dreadful. Onboard service was rushed and not very friendly and to top it all we had one of the flight attendants talking loudly with passengers at the back throughout the whole night. Of course that meant that even without entertainment there was also no sleeping for those of us unlucky enough to be in this attendant's vicinity.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

Check in was efficient and friendly and the flight was uneventful except for the crew who made the whole experience feel very uncomfortable. I have never experienced cabin crew like it. Its a given that everyone has an off day once and a while but some of the crews interactions with the passengers that I witnessed were uncalled for. Crew were short unfriendly disinterested and deliberately ignored some passengers. At one stage I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience when I asked for a paper towel to dry up some water I accidentally spilled. In the end I had to queue at the toilets as I was informed I was capable of getting my own towels as the crew were busy. When we landed and were disembarking the crew thanked me for flying the New American Airlines. I don't know why BA codeshare with this airline as the service standards are at complete opposites of the scale. When I book my next flight I will make sure I know what airline I'm flying so I'm not on a code share with AA.,,,Economy,,3,4,1,2,3,,,4,0

I told my husband after the first plane that I would never fly American again. It was 3 planes there and 3 back. The seats were the most tiny and uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. I am 5 ft 2 and 115 lbs so by no means am I a big person. The staff were awful. I have never met people so disinterested and rude. When leaving Punta Cana we sat in line for 1.5 hours because there was no one there to check us in! Every other airline were getting people through. We made it to our flight in the nick of time.

In Dallas we switched planes (again operated by American Airlines) what was supposed to be a 2 hour layover became an 8 hour layover. The legroom was non existent and when the people in front of us tilted chairs back we could hardly move for 10 hours. miserable. I will not support American Airlines to Europe or even to Dallas.

I have Gold status on AA so I was able to obtain a Main Cabin Extra seat on the first flight free of charge and an exit-row seat on the second flight. The ground experience at CDG was okay and they were pretty well organized. The first flight took off on-time although we had to board by bus (something that probably irritates every passenger). Cabin crew were okay and there was no IFE which I knew to expect even though practically every other carrier has it by now. The connection at ORD was amazingly painless and security was a breeze. The Eagle flight was delayed due to a late inbound aircraft but we landed a mere 30 minutes behind schedule and my checked bag was waiting for me on the carousel just 10 minutes or so after landing.

No hot drinks snacks or food available which is pretty poor for a what's scheduled as a 3 hour flight. No entertainment on offer the flight got me from A to B but that's about it.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Joao De Assuncao,Australia,5/4/2014,"I am currently sitting at LAX airport and having the worst experience I had with an airline. I arrived in LA this morning by Qantas from Perth-Sydney and upon going through the ""Express Connection"" I was informed by one of the ground crew members that I would be required to take my luggage and check-in inside the terminal. When I arrived in the terminal I was sent by American Airlines employees to 3 different places to try to drop-in my baggage. When I finally arrived in the last spot (45 min prior to flight schedule time) I was informed that I wouldn't be able to check-in my bags nor take them in the cabin despite having had checked-in on-line prior to going to the airport. She them put my wife and me in ""stand-by"" list for a flight 2 hours later and checked our bags-in. I was placed in second in the list at that moment (again according to the front desk lady because I am a ""One World Sapphire Member"" and would be put in front of other people in similar situations. In the half hour preceding the boarding time our name had escalated to 6th and 7th on the list. I tried to (very politely) speak with the lady at the boarding desk 3 times but she in each time she rudely answered ""Stand-by I will be with you in a second!"" In the end she suggested that one of us should take a remaining seat and the other wait for the next flight. We decided to do that as the next flight seat wouldn't be warrant as well. Everything was dealt in a rush/unplanned manner showing AA have no control to handle such situations. Now I am here hoping to not get bumped again or get stuck in LA for the night after 16 hrs flying from Australia then meet my wife at my destination and go to the hotel to have a rest.

We were lucky enough to get a discounted fare so that Business Class was a bit cheaper than the economy class fares available. On the MEX-DFW leg plane was an old and a bit worn out MD80. Good flight with a really kind and helpful flight assistant who spoke a perfect Spanish. I don't fly AA often but I must admit that I've always found nice and smiling staff both in business and economy class. Good to know that if you have an international connection via DFW you no longer need to retrieve and recheck your baggage to your final destination. We went through immigration very fast and headed for the Admiral's Club which is really disappointing: no snacks except for cookies only 1 alcoholic drink per person unfriendly staff. On the bright side wifi was good and the view on the tarmac was excellent. The DFW-YUL leg was on a newer 737 and it was an uneventful flight with a good lunch but a very poor selection of drinks.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,C Shiels,United Kingdom,4/28/2014,I flew from San Francisco to Heathrow on April 26th and found the airline crew working in economy to be both unfriendly and unprofessional. The most senior of the crew had an abrupt manner I noticed on more than one occasion her behaviour towards passengers who accidentally happened to get in her way in the galley area there was no politeness shown in terms of politely asking them to move but eye rolling and heavy sighing. My pillow happened to fall into aisle without my knowledge and I was reprimanded by this senior crew member for allowing this to happen! The crew whilst serving beverages/food would not engage in any conversation or pleasantries with passengers instead they would look right through you if you smiled at them they would not smile back when I exited the economy area on leaving the plane a couple of the crew stood near the exit area and there was again no pleasantries or smiles just silence. Only on leaving the plane did a friendly crew member who I believe had been working in First Class or Business Class speak to me and said 'thanks for flying with us have a good day'. I have flown with many airlines and I have to say that my return flight home with AA was the worst experience I have ever known and because of this I will not be flying with AA again. AA show a video to their passengers before a flight which promotes the technology investments they have made in relation to improving the customer experience. I would recommend to AA that they focus more attention and investment into the training of their crew to provide a better service to their customers.,,,Economy,,2,2,2,2,3,,,3,0

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,C Christopher,United States,4/24/2014,LGA-PBI April 19th 2014 was overall great. Flight was on time and we even landed early. The crew of flight attendants and pilots were nothing great flight attendants didn't give much personal attention to the passengers it seemed. We were seated in Main Cabin Extra in the front row (8A8B8C). Main Cabin Extra is supposed to have 6 inches of extra legroom since we were seated in the front with the bulkhead in front of us which is really just a wall for those of you who don't know it did not feel like we had 6 inches of legroom and it felt very cramped through the whole area. If you are about to pay extra money for main cabin extra avoid the first rows which is row 8. I'm not sure about 8D 8E 8F but I assume it's the same. Also the tray tables are considerably smaller because they are stowed in the arm rest. But they are kind of cool to an airline enthusiast like myself because it feels like a first class seat. We did not have to pay for Main Cabin Extra because my family had Gold member free Main Cabin Extra so for us it didn't matter but if you have to pay for MCE I would sit any row behind 8. All in all great flight and I love American they will always be my #1 airline to fly and I would still recommend flying them just not in row 8 MCE.,,,Premium Economy,,7,3,3,2,1,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M Brownstone,United States,4/22/2014,My recent trip with American Airlines has made me become a United loyalist. I have sworn to myself to never fly American again. The horror started at the check-in at JFK. You'd think if there was a merger between American and US Airways that passengers could check in anywhere. No the quite literally 60 open and manned desks were for US Airways passengers only while the AA passengers had to get in line somewhere off to the side where there were two people working. On the plane a stewardess was sitting on the jump seat in the exit row and could not stop talking to a passenger in a very loud voice. Returning from LA the check-in procedure was hands down the most inefficient system I've seen in my life. Once boarded we had a plane from I don't know when but practically no one's baggage fit in the overhead compartment everyone had to check their bags and the whole thing delayed us by about thirty minutes. The stewardess must have elbowed me in the head at least a dozen times and woke me up once to ask if I'd like to drink something. No thank I was fine just sleeping.

I asked two different employees for a Supervisor and both of them told me there wasn't one. I had to go to a different airline and they got me an AA supervisor. The own AA employees outright lied to me about a supervisor. They scheduled me on a 6am flight the next morning and yet again they had issues.

Seat width adequate seat pitch could use an additional inch but seat cushion comfort rock hard and unacceptable! I saw nothing international about their heralded international flagship service. The dinners served in both directions were big on flavor/taste but small in serving size. The salad ex/NYC had seen better days but the salad ex/BUE was crisp excellent and fresh. Dessert ex/NYC was a tasty pre-packaged chocolate brownie but only a 'Bon o Bon' ex/BUE. What was referred to as breakfast on both flights was a warm croissant with butter and jam served with OJ and a fruit yoghurt ex/NYC and OJ a very fresh fruit salad ex/BUE. The catering ex/BUE was of a much higher calibre/quality than that out of NYC/JFK. On both flights the inflight cabin crews were efficiently friendly and served with smiles.

When we tried to check-in online there were only 5 paid seats together - the others were scattered around the plane. Clearly we couldn't sit the 3 children on their own so we contacted AA and were told we'd have to pay the extra (£220) and book the paid seats which we did very reluctantly. When we checked in at the desk however we were told we couldn't have the seats we'd booked and were given 5 others which were a 2 and a 3. During the second leg of the trip we were given exit seats which were not allowed for children as we were told they would be 'a good bargaining tool' for swaps. On the return we couldn't sit at all near each other: 3 of us sat on the very back row and 2 at the front of the plane. However AA used BA as a carrier for the final leg - they had automatically allocated five seats together because we were travelling with children and allowed us onto the plane first - a completely different attitude from AA. I agree with former reviews - the seatbelt signs hardly went off on the AA flights which is unacceptable on long-haul.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,D Graubard,United States,4/6/2014,AA997 DFW-EZE on 4 April - First Class. Overall a great experience. The purser was very personable and professional. 777-200 plane which has seen better days - for a first class seat (that I will say was super comfortable to sleep in as it was totally flat and they give you a thin mattress which makes it much better) there were so many little tears and things that made the seat look tatty. Food was good - appetizer soup (great pumpkin soup) salad chicken and veggies and desert. In-flight TV on AA is always a joke compared to any other carrier - too few TV shows - too few updated recent movies - super small screen for a first class experience. But for the price and the overall service - AA wins on this flight. I have recently had a lot of flights and AA has been doing great. Keep up the great work!,,,First Class,,9,4,5,5,3,,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Stephanie Curl,United States,4/4/2014,We flew in from Jamaica to Dallas Fort Worth Texas and our flight was delayed. The biggest problem was that there was little information given to passengers. After 2 hours we found out we were waiting for a crew to arrive from another destination. After being delayed 4 hours we finally got on the plane to sit on the runway for another 45 minutes. The pilot said we were being re-routed due to weather and did not have enough fuel and would have to go back to the gate to refuel. We reach the gate at 2am and wait to only be told the flight was now cancelled. This is where I truly get frustrated with the way things were handled. 150+ passengers are told their flight is cancelled but there is no other flights going into Louisville. You will have to find another way home or wait until Wednesday (6 days later)! We wait in line another 1.5 hrs to try and find a flight close to home willing to drive the rest of the way. The gate agents have been no help whatsoever it was 5.30 in the morning and they offered no cots or anything to us. There were no hotel rooms. They did give us a $12 voucher for a meal. Finally got a late flight almost 24 hours later to Cincinnati but now have to incur additional expense of renting a car to get home. Tried to get on a couple of standby flights but I have noticed that AA overbooked every flight and boots people off so stand by is a joke. Highly disappointed!,,,Economy,,1,5,1,2,2,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,B Kelley,United States,4/3/2014,Paid $1700 for two seats. Airline website would not allow us to choose seats at time of booking. Return a week later to book and lo and behold only paid seats left. Call Airline and told unless we pay and additional $170 per person we will have to depend on the kindness of others to move seats so we can sit together. This is absolute crap. If you can't book your seats at time of booking then don't buy the ticket unless you're willing to pay additional $$$ to actually get a seat.,,,Economy,,1,3,3,3,3,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Alan Bartz,Germany,4/3/2014,We flew from MCO via MIA to Punta Cana. The first leg was fine and for an hours flight every was completely satisfying. The second leg from Miami to Punta Cana was a total disappointment for my first international flight with AA. At the airport I was rejected to enter the lounge as for flights to The Caribbean the access is excluded. This logic I will never understand. The two flight attendants have been absolutely passive in their service and spent their time rather with making jokes with each other or actively ignoring requests such as a glass of water or getting visa documents. One flight attendant had his hands in his pockets at all times - while going through the aisle. I have never been so disappointed from a Business Class flight before. For sure AA will not have me as a customer onboard again and I am glad that there are a lot of options on the US flight market.,,,Business Class,,2,3,1,2,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M Thompson,United States,4/2/2014,AA 324 MCO-DFW in First. Flight on time pre-ordered snack delivered cheerfully pre-departure drinks offered. Inflight the Attendant could not do enough for everyone. Ordered 5 star connecting service and arrival service. Was met at the arriving gate at DFW and taken by golf cart to the Admirals Club in Concourse D. I was able to bypass the Admirals club check in line handed Premium Drink vouchers and told I would be greeted by someone else to take me to my next flight. Shortly afterward the weather turned horrible for about an hour. My new 5 star agent found me in the Admirals Club and asked if I had any questions. I had her check to make sure the plane taking me to Santiago Chile made it on the ground. She came back to confirm it was on the ground but waiting for a gate due to the weather. Near boarding time she collected me and carted me off to the gate. I was carted back to the Admirals Club and asked to be kept informed of the situation. I was collected again and informed the new plane was ready but they were under tight time constraints to get it going due to crew time restraints. AA's Flagship suite is comfortable the turn down service pyjamas slippers and kit were all very nice. The international crew in First save for one employee were polite but simply went through the motions. The food was decent. Filled out the Breakfast Card and awoke to a nice breakfast and a wonderful view of the Andes as the sun was rising. Despite the Delay in DFW good job by AA.,,,First Class,,9,5,5,5,3,,,4,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M Thompson,United States,4/2/2014,"I arrived 4 hours early for my late afternoon flight to Orlando after my cruise. I was confirmed in Main Cabin Extra. Miami has always been a ""challenging"" airport but not having been there in over a decade it was a whole new challenge. My bag was 5 lbs overweight so I had to go buy a small personal carry item and remove 5 lbs from my bag. Needless to say a huge hassle. Since I checked in so early American did not offer to put me on one of the several flight before mine but they certainly did send my bag early as it was already in this huge mire when I arrived in Orlando. The security situation in Miami is a nightmare. Once finally through the drama the new terminal AA built was nice with allot more choices of things to do but it seemed gate after gate I passed no one cleaned up the trash left by the customers. Flight boarded on time I asked for some tissue got it promptly then only saw the Flight attendants during seat belt check before and take off and landing. They all seemed to pile into F class and offer multiple drink rounds. Main Cabin Extra is what AA Coach used to be minus the service. We arrived on time and my bag had been waiting hours for me.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,R Vines,United Kingdom,4/2/2014,I hadn't flown American since the mid-80s when the service varied between passive-aggressive and actively unpleasant.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,O Thompson,United States,3/31/2014,6 flights with AA in the past month or two. JFK-MIA: Arrived at check-in counter on time. Staff were friendly enough and seemed to be at ease but maintained proper professionalism. Flight waited 20 minutes at the gate before taxiing because of some missing passengers. Nice well maintained 757 seats were comfortable although not the best and flight attendants were nice. Rather bad entertainment. 2 hour flight landed in Miami with no issues. MIA-MGA (Nicaragua): Had roughly a 2 hour layover until connecting flight was scheduled. Everything went smoothly no complaints there. Flight into Managua was a little worse - 757 was a bit dilapidated and we had about an hour delay before taking off. Staff at the gate upon landing pointed us towards our destination and were very welcoming. MGA-MIA-JFK: Return flight went well nothing really remarkable. Everything was on time staff were nice and helpful seats were alright. JFK-LHR: On one of the older 777-200ER aircraft. Staff very friendly and professional. One of the flight attendants even went as far as to sit down and conduct conversation with a few of the passengers during the flight and gave off a very good vibe. Throughout the 6 hour flight the flight the attendants came around frequently and often were available to provide passengers with snacks and drinks whenever prompted. Seats were surprisingly comfortable and the flight wasn't even half full so almost everyone in Economy had the chance to fully recline across the 5 seat middle aisle (One of the advantages of the 200ER over the 300ER). Meals were actually pretty decent and I had few complaints. Fairly good entertainment with a selection of about 30 films and 10 TV shows. Flight landed smoothly and we were quickly on our way through customs and security. LHR-JFK: The flight was a little more crowded but there was still room to switch seats and there were a few open middle aisles to lie down on. Lunch was a small pizza which wasn't too bad. Flight landed smoothly and there were staff at the door to greet us. Would fly again.,,,Economy,,8,3,5,4,3,,,3,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Robert Phillips,United States,3/31/2014,I was traveling home from Palm Springs CA. through Dallas. Flight was delayed 3 times through e-mail notification before any gate agent was seen. When I asked the young lady about our flight she didn't know anything. After a couple of calls she made an announcement. All I wanted was some info so I knew what to do next. After boarding and taxiing to the runway we were told we did not have enough fuel to make it around the approaching storm. Then the flight was canceled and re-instated in about 15 minutes. After we did land 6 hours late in Shreveport I called customer relations and they were not helpful at all. I was offered $200 toward my next travel.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Ant Richards,United Kingdom,3/30/2014,23 March. JAX to DFW to connect with a BA flight back to LHR (comment later). Aircraft MD83. I took this flight with very low expectations following past experience and general comments. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. Check-in at JAX was swift friendly and cruised past security in no time; was offered Fast Track and then again JAX is not the busiest of airports in the US. Unfortunately there are no lounges for premium passengers unless you are flying DL or their Skyteam partners. Boarding was relatively ordered. Was greeted with a smile (first impression counts) and shown to my seat by the friendly stewardess. Unlike many European carriers on their shorthaul aircraft's the premium cabins in this case do have distinct seating in their different classes. For the type of aircraft and duration of flight I would say it was quite appropriate - no use expecting a flatbed or deluxe booth for a two hour + flight. Once boarding was complete announcements were made hot towels offered followed by a choice of bubbly juice or water. Lift off was on time and flight pretty smooth most of the time. A few bumps here and there but that's part of flying. Service was above my expectations the stewardess was extremely friendly helpful and fully justified the premium escence of the cabin. Main and only disappointment was the food. Not bad but certainly not a First Class offering. On shorter Asian and European journeys the offering is far superior in a comparable cabin. On the other hand being a nut-allergy sufferer the pre-lunch aperitif of warm nuts was a no-go for me however this charming lady went out of her way to get me an appropriate (and definitely yummier) substitute - corn chips with a houmous dip. Landing was a bit later than scheduled but beforehand I was explained the best way of getting to my connecting flight. Surprisingly and with a mere 40 minutes to spare my bag even made it to my connection. Well done American!,,,First Class,,6,2,5,3,1,,,2,1

Rebooked flight to FRA via DFW was delayed for another hour so we thought it could get close again. So we asked for the gate for our connection flight. After reaching the gate we were told that this is the wrong gate and the flight is delayed or another three hours. All ground staff were rude and not willing to get us asap to FRA.

Flight attendants in Biz Class were great - super friendly and smiles. Purser came and greeted each passenger - and his partner FA was all smiles and anticipated your needs which was amazing.

Both flights on time the food edible the service efficient if not enthusiastic the seats cramped and uncomfortable. AA deploys a 767-300 on this route a fine 20th century workhorse but woefully inadequate for the 21st century in passenger comfort and technology - only cabin ceiling monitors for in flight entertainment.

First bad weather cancels flight which can hardly be blamed on the airline. Not being able to even reach an agent to rebook for 48 hours and being forced to use an alternate airline to make meeting. Most definitely can. Second sat on tarmac for an hour waiting quite literally for a piece of paper certifying weight and then being forced to return to gate and refuel when minimum safe fuel line is broken was not fun. Having to literally run to connecting flight is even less fun. Especially when a comfortable wait was programmed into original flight. Third went to check in for overseas flight booked by government and after standing in line (no military bypass in system for check in) was unapologetically and without assistance punted to partner airline to stand in line for another hour. Because people who ticket with AA are just supposed to know this - particularly when standard check in procedures block military travel and leaves you stranded. Do the airlines really think making people wait needlessly and unapologetically is a good thing?,,,Business Class,,1,2,1,1,1,,,3,0

The so called inflight entertainment (1 film for a 8.5 hour flight) broke after 10 minutes of starting and was off for an hour then anyway. When the ""food"" turned up I was given some cold pasta as there was no chicken left so it was this slop or nothing it was inedible so left it. On the way home there was a 2 hour delay and a gate change from 1 to 35. This time I got chicken but service was done in the dark and again only one film for a transatlantic flight so no distractions there or back which meant plenty of clock watching.

As a seasoned traveller countless delays and negative experiences I still go about it with a smile. The negative experiences that I have I often just take with a smile. Not so this time. American Airlines provoked me so much on my last flights with them. I travel often in both economy and business as a paying customer. This time I was in business class with ""The New"" American and their 777-300ER. The product is great so is the food and the IFE. But the crew of AA are a disgrace. From the moment I stepped on the airplane an aura of unwelcomeness was hanging in the air. The crew were stressed and did not have time for anything but to run. No smiles nothing mostly just grumpy faces. After a dinner service that took forever to get going and that was served with a slap in the face I went to their famous buffèt of snacks to have some water and some fruit. As I did that one of the two flight attendants sitting there asked me: ""Didn't you eat already?"" I stood there feeling unwelcome. I don't pay a business class ticket to be met by such an attitude.

Seats were comfortable with adjustable headrest with plenty of space between my knees and seat in front. They were comparable to United's economy plus seats. Service was friendly and professional. The aircraft had wifi which could be purchased and the bandwidth was more than adequate for getting email and work done. All safety announcements and instructions seem to be pre recorded in a voice with a a neutral calm tone. As is the case in most US domestic they only have beverage service but they give you the whole along with glass as oppose to UA where they only fill the ice filled plastic cup. Inflight entertainment consisted of overhead monitors with requirement to purchase headphones however wifi availability made up for this.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,3,4,,,3,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,J Segal,United States,3/5/2014,JFK-MAD return. Both flights on time and fine. 757 used which meant tired outdated and unusable IFE from drop down screens in the aisle. Be warned if in window seat you will not be able to see the entire screen. MCE seating wonderful to provide extra leg room on these long flights. Exit row seat seemed thin ended up sitting on my pillow for most of the flight! Crew on both legs were good return trip they were smiling and engaging. Something not expected often! Food acceptable but let's be honest-nothing to travel for!

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M Barbieri,United States,3/4/2014,AA does not care about its customers or understand why getting customers to their destinations on time matters. AA Flight number 132 was cancelled after sitting on the plane for 40 minutes due to a mechanical issue with the aircraft. The AA flight crew knowingly boarded the entire flight of passengers even though they knew the black box/communication box to the flight deck tower was broken and required repair. Many passengers had a connecting flight out of Dallas Fort Worth airport the destination for AA Flight 132. After 30 minutes of waiting with no information the flight crew informed us that the plane had a mechanical issue and the repair was being made. 10 minutes later the flight crew announced that the repair could not be made and the plane would be decommissioned. Asked to de-plane and had to wait another 10 minutes. Finally landed in Dallas. I ran through the airport and we were able to make the second flight (not our originally scheduled flight) and we made it. Flight attendants on this flight (AA Flight number 2467) were not helpful. No crew member helped us move overhead bags to get our bags up or helped communicate to another passenger to move his jacket down or a small bag that should be under such passengers seat. We finally landed in Los Angeles. We lost the chance to get to Honolulu on Saturday February 8 as planned and paid for. After waiting in line we received our voucher for one night at the airport Holiday Inn in Los Angeles and a $39.00 voucher for dinner for 3 people and an $18 voucher for breakfast on Sunday Feb. 9 also for 3 people (in LAX!).,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

This would have been an on time departure however during a strong storm our B737-800 aircraft was struck by high winds just before push back. Maintenance was called and an inspection was made with no damage noted. The flight crew kept us fully informed and drinks were served in first class during the delay. We finally took off through very turbulent weather. The crew kept us fully informed of the weather conditions as the flight attendants had to remain seated for quite some time due to the turbulence. Once past Palm Springs the ride became very comfortable and dinner was served. The ""teriyaki beef with sugar snap beans and sticky rice"" was unremarkable although the salad and dessert (freshly baked and still warm chocolate chip cookies) were fine. The red wine from Washington state was fine as well. Cabin service was excellent. Due to strong tail winds we were only about 15 minutes late arriving in DFW and I made my connection to LFT via AA Eagle with no problems. Early arrival in LFT and my checked bag arrived on the belt quickly. All in all a terrific job by AA and AA Eagle.",,,First Class,,9,4,5,3,3,,,4,1

It was my first time to fly this aircraft and it's really great. I think it now must be the best business class product on the transatlantic - much better than BA. The seat is really comfortable. Great if you are travelling alone and get a window seat and you have complete privacy. The FA looking after me was very friendly and attentive. The International Terminal D at DFW must be the best international transfer experience in the US better than most European airports.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Ben Thomson,United Kingdom,2/26/2014,This was our first and last time will be flying with AA first with the 2 hour delay that wasn't their fault but we did not get a phone call like other passengers there was no cabin crew when we boarded the plane nor did they do cabin check (both journeys). We asked about upgrading to business class we were told it was full yet there were some empty seats and 2 of the cabin crew were in them. My mother and I both paid £75 each for extra leg room yet the 2 sat next us (both journeys again) said they didn't.

Got caught in Ft Laud customs grubby facility more than 2 hours to get to an officer (5 on duty) - but US Citizens breezed through their own line while the rest of us shuffled forward. I politely mentioned I was going to miss my connection (no sympathy) and was told ""be quiet and stay in line."" Got to baggage claim and another massive line to leave - AA agent tried to rescue me and was rudely treated by customs and I was put back in line (I said nothing). From there on a gong show with AA - later and later flights missed connections no one to help at the gates sent into a line for help and told ""we are closing - sorry"" leave security and come back in and see if an AA check-in is open. Got some polite help from one AA staff - ended up stuck overnight. Next leg to Vancouver in a brand new plane with TVs in the seat (I am used to that on Air Canada) - many passenger asked for - PA announced ""this is a new plane we don't know how to operate the TVs either - if you need help ask a young person they might know.""

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Klaus Luckert,Costa Rica,2/25/2014,I am still not a big fan of AA but it looks like that they are now working harder to provide to their pax some kind of decent flight experience. Flew recently SJO-MIA-DEN/RT. On SJO-MIA still operating the old 757 but with a refurbished cabin at least. MIA-DEN newish 737-800. Nice aircraft. Ground handling efficient and friendly. They assigned me an exit row and main cabin exit seats for free without asking. All pilots talked to the pax providing a lot of flight info. The winner was the 757 Captain of the flight MIA-SJO. After appreciating his clients over the mike he also took the time to bid a farewell to every pax exiting the plane with a Thank You and a smile. Even though their inflight service still leaves a lot to wish it is a nice manner to show each passenger the value they deserve. Overall a good experience and I'll fly AA again.,,,Economy,,5,3,3,2,2,,,3,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,K Rossi,United States,2/25/2014,Chicago to Dubai Frequent Flyer on American via LH. Been a loyal customer since the 1980's. It's really a shame how this airline has degraded. The planes I fly are always really old virtually no entertainment system at all if it even works there's no leg room and seats are often old smelly and sometimes broken. On one flight the bathroom floor was cracked. Staff are always great but they have a really poor product to work with and their frustration shows.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,B Crockford,United States,2/25/2014,DFW-SEA in new 737 which was refreshing compared to previous AA flights on old planes however the new seats are cramped and feel more uncomfortable than older aircraft. In seat VOD is a huge improvement however it appears that AA will be charging for this in future along with earphones and food. Another downside is that the screen does not adjust. Even with the seat in front not reclined the viewing angle for a person of average height is poor and soon results in a neck ache. There is the question of service or more particularly lack there-of and attitude. This flight was no exception and service was delivered abruptly and with only occasional customer respect. I asked for a cup of tea (complimentary) and was given a cup of hot water and a tea bag on the side. With AA it's a case of get on board (sometimes you're welcomed other times you're not) sit down pay for everything other than basics (and if you want water mid flight go get it but be sure to ask permission if you're not interrupting the staff talking to each other at the back) don't complain then get off (and you might get thanked for your custom from an FA who might be sat on one of the seats - although at least the Captain often thanks you). On the plus side this flight was very punctual and baggage delivered quickly but that speaks more to the efficiency of others.,,,Economy,,3,2,1,1,3,,,2,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Frank Ellsworth,Switzerland,2/24/2014,Flight Zurich to JFK. Very old 767 plane - 21 years - showing excessive wear and tear. Dirty torn carpets and seat covers. Such an old and poorly maintained plane does not feel safe. No entertainment system other than a shaky old style TV hung from the ceiling. No magazines or newspapers provided (other than the thin airline's magazine). Food quality was average - liquor costs extra. The only commendable thing was the friendly crew and the fact that the plane was at most half full. Apparently the word about these run down planes has spread and few people choose AA on a route which also has a direct flight from Swiss. AA terminal at JFK is catastrophic. Luggage takes almost an hour to arrive and when departing the wait time at security was exceeded 90 minutes.,,,Economy,,2,2,3,2,1,,,2,0

I had the lowest expectations having flown AA many times in the past both business and pleasure although not for some years. Check-in and security were the usual Manchester Airport slick and fast why can't Heathrow learn from them? On boarding we were met by a smiling and effusive purser who was greeting every passenger. Don't know if my BA Gold Card had anything to do with it but we were seated just behind Business in extra leg room seats. Yes the plane was an antique and had no seat back entertainment which almost beggars believe but it was clean and all seats and trays appeared to work for AA an achievement! We departed on time and arrived on time. We were served the preposterously named ""International Flagship"" lunch which was actually not bad for economy. Apart from the excellent purser the cabin crew went through the motions but were not rude or bad tempered which is a major improvement. US immigration was fast and the staff actually smiled. AA cabin crew and US immigration staff smiling what is the world coming to? Overall we were pleasantly surprised and would use again for the benefit of flying direct.",,,Economy,,7,3,4,3,1,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Bielli David,United States,2/24/2014,"LAX-LHR return in Biz. AA put their new 777-300ER on this route and I have to say that they are nearly on the top of the market with this product. Lounge at LAX - not so great I am EP the highest but have to admit the lounge is lacking lots of food options. There were nearly none except few sandwiches. Compared to BA First class in Terminal 3 which is not their best the AA just does not stack up. The aircraft itself is great. Biz has walk-up bar which if the flight attendants are not too lazy has constant food. And this is where it becomes tricky. Flight attendants on AA are hit and miss. I flew them 5 times in the past few months. The same route. Sometimes you get great serving people who really care and would do anything for you and then you get a lady like I did who when I walked up to the bar in the middle of the flight and asked for a glass of water - since there was none anywhere had to close her game on her iPad annoyingly lifted her eyes and proceeded to look. When she found the bottle she slammed it on the bar and said "" You will be able to pour it yourself - I hope"". Seat itself is great. I recommend row 5 window - it has an extra space to store your stuff. Plenty of room to stock things up. Food - really great for biz class they elevated their game with wines as well. I can't fault them for anything in terms of hard product. The choices of movies - great. I am comparing to my recent trip on BA which had about 1/3 of movies. That really surprised me.

I fly often and usually have 1 to 2 bags that weigh from 60 to 100lbs and have never been asked to pay. AA seems to have different requirement on baggage weights from state to state.

Have travelled business class with many different airlines over the decades and never experienced such disregard. For personal reasons we need a window seat and aisle so the moment we book a flight we go online and book our seats. These are always without fail honoured. But American Airlines have already thrown us out of our pre-books seats 3 times relocating us in inappropriate seats and separated! Each time we have re-books seats but today find they have moved us again and suddenly all other seats are full! We phoned only to be told that they were not prepared to move other passengers despite them being single travellers even though they had moved us three times without reference to our wishes.

JFK was recovering from a snow-storm but that doesn't forgive the appalling service delivered by AA to passengers stuck for 8 hours on what should be a 3-hour flight. 1 hour late departure ATC orders no blame. 45 minutes holding pattern somewhere off the coast around DC a further delay. Running out of fuel so we have to land in Philadelphia. Quick refuel and push-back only to stop halfway through because the tow-bar has broken. Then return to the gate for one passenger to deplane no explanation but efficiently and quickly done. Land at JFK at 10.45 pm. No gate held on taxiway get assigned gate but access blocked by de-icing an outbound plane assigned another gate so taxi a couple of hundred yards then stop. Eventually move to gate but another 15-minute delay. Eventually get to the gate and disembark at 12.30 am. Wait for baggage is interminable and at first there is no information as to which carousel it's coming on. I get mine at about 1.50 am and that's marked Priority. In 8 hours on the plane there was one drinks service no additional refreshment except for a hand-out of an oat bar.

When we got on the plane the pre-flight drinks were sitting on the table of one of the business class seats. Everything rushed. Hostesses do just the bare minimum required. Earphones faulty. Had them changed and the new ones didn't work. Turns out the socket for the earphones in my seat was broken. So no inflight entertainment for me for the whole flight unless I was prepared for visuals only. Then got a cup of coffee in a filthy cup. Admirals Lounge in JFK is a joke. Pretzels cheese carrots apples some juice and coffee. That's it. You have to pay for anything else at airport prices. Then they looked for $10.50 for a glass of wine. I thought the girl behind the bar was joking. She wasn't. She reluctantly told me that one wine was complimentary and she begrudgingly served it.

Meanwhile I receive a call from my wife who says she received a call at home stating my connecting flight out of Charlotte had been delayed but the counter clerk had already told me that flight was cancelled too.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Laina Shuey,United States,2/12/2014,2/9/14 LAX to Chicago. I am extremely disappointed with American Airlines customer service. Staff were unfriendly and rude during the boarding and ticketing process. During the check-in process I received a message that I had not chosen a seat and was asked to pay an additional $68 for an upgraded seat. From the mobile phone the check-in process could not be completed until this upgrade was purchased. At the airport during the self check-in it was clear a seat had been chosen and no upgrade was needed at that time. Why are the two systems not compatible with each other? During boarding they allowed all passengers to board who did not have roller bags. This then resulted in less space for these roller bags during the boarding process. Flight attendant's allowed customers to place small bags and coats in the overhead compartments. When it came time to board the roller bags there was not enough room for these bags. This could have been avoided had the staff asked these other customers to please remove smaller items and place under the seat. Instead they were then rude to those with roller bags who did not have enough space accusing them of delaying the flight further. This seems like a rather inefficient process and one that should be reviewed to provide better customer service to those flying on American.,,,Economy,,1,3,1,3,3,,,1,0

Old 777-200 but the cabin was maintained pretty well and clean. Boarded last because of a late connection whisked into an almost empty first class. Food service was quick and good the steak I ordered was surprisingly good. An old flight attendant turned out to be a very funny and nice man who did everything to make the flight better and knew when to leave me alone (sleeping). Personal TV screen was not of the highest quality but personal none the less and thus enjoyable. Lay flat seat worked just fine and the ability to swivel and work on a desk was a plus.

Our original flight to IAH Houston was scheduled for 3.15pm at 2.55pm (local time) and arriving at 5.55pm the gate attendant told us that the flight had been delayed for an unspecified amount of time. We soon learned that the gate had been changed no announcement by telecom only by looking at the airport television screens did we figure this out. The new departure time was 3:34pm but that didn't happen either so the staff delayed the flight again to 4.04pm. As 4.15pm approached everyone was finally seated on this haggard and small CR7 jet. As we were about to leave the gate the pilot said there needed to be some maintenance and that it would take ""5 minutes"" to complete. 5 minutes passed and then 10 and then 20. By this time it was 4.25pm and we had yet to leave the gate. At 4.45pm we began taxing onto the runway when another problem arose. There apparently was an electrical failure and maintenance needed to be done once again. Back to the gate we go and by now its 5.10pm. Maintenance fixed the problem and off we go!

First class is a complete joke with only 2 rows. The bulkhead is extraordinarily uncomfortable and the last and second row simply horrible as seat cannot recline because it is placed physically against the partition between first and coach cabins. Entertainment? Lots of options If the controls work (I was in two seats and none worked properly). All these in addition to an over two-hours delay (excused by the nasty weather in the USA the last couple of weeks). What did not have an excuse at all was the extremely dirty plane (bathroom was not even flushed when first passengers boarded). AA flights to Colombia have shown substandard service and equipment for the longest. I hope all the positive changes in AA's culture that have started being evident after the merger with USAirways also benefit USA-Colombia travelers. In the meantime my personal advice to AA's Bogota-bound travelers: do not pay Business or First. AA is generally a good value in the back of the plane but not worth pay premium cabin for a substandard product and service into Bogota. I recommend AA anywhere but Colombia-bound routes.,,,First Class,,1,1,5,3,3,,,1,0

To my right on the other side of the aisle there was a lady with an empty seat next to her. She wanted to fold up the armrest so she could sleep across but the armrest would not stay up which was later solved by flight attendants using masking tape. My reading light was broken. American Airlines truly lived up to what US airlines are famous for - grumpy flight attendants shouting at foreign passengers who merely wanted to find out more about the food they were being served. And while on food absolutely horrible and I am sure anyone on that flight would have described it as such. Same chicken and rice dish for both meals but called different names. Same sauce same meat but one with carrots and onions. Not asking for Michelin- starred gourmet meals but this was just miles apart from coach class catering at other airlines I have flown with for example Cathay or Japan Airlines.

THe walk up bar with snacks during the flight was great as were the massive toilets in which you can change into more comfy wear for sleeping pj's are not provided. Bose headphones made for cinema sound and the amenity kit was of a good quality too. Food servings being on an American carrier are generous. All in all an excellent product and this does give Emirates and Etihad a run for their money as one of the best in the sky - well worth a try.,,,Business Class,,9,5,5,5,5,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Pierre Longpré,,1/29/2014,Originally meant to flu YUL-LGA/JFK-CDG on Dec 24th 2013 and CDG-JFK-YUL on Jan 5th 2014 but a lot of changes occurred! Our JFK-CDG was cancelled due to weather in Paris. Flight from YUL-LGA was finally cancelled at the gate they rescheduled us on Air Canada to BOS (CRJ50) then British Airways to LHR. AA agents were ok and all speck fluent French. On the BOS-LHR flight (B747-400) they put us in premium economy seating was good but meal disgusting. Arrived at LHR around 4.50am we had our CDG flight scheduled at 3pm but British Airways found places for us on an earlier flight (A320). Our return wasn't cancelled as we entered the plane a B757-200 wifi- equipped we and 10 other passengers were told to go back to the gate. Given vouchers 800USD each Hyatt hotel and complimentary meals. The next morning staff helped us find the best flight. CDG-MIA-YUL. The 10 hours long CDG-MIA flight was on an outdated B767-300 but was really clean. Food was better than BA but still not as AF or Egyptair. No individual TV of course but good seat. I was able to sleep. The rest of the trip MIA-YUL was on an B737-800. Normal flight free beverages and everything else we needed to pay for. Great staff. I would fly them again.,,,Economy,,8,4,5,2,1,,,5,1
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,C Thomas,United Kingdom,1/28/2014,AA47 LHR-ORD in Business - maybe 70% full on Saturday lunchtime. 777-200 with 2-3-2 business class. Attentive crew a mixture of experienced and new who showed a real pride in the service they offered. Good concise communication from the flight deck. Food OK wine reasonable (although does show cost cutting vs 4 years ago when I last flew this route). Cabin showing a little wear and tear but generally OK and serviceable. IFE showing its age but again perfectly OK for an 8 hour stretch. Half the price of BA (although BA were in gouging mode because the flight was booked within 2 weeks of departure). On time departure 10 minutes early arrival. A decent product when delivered by a crew who care as was the case this time.,,,Business Class,,8,4,5,3,3,,,3,1

It is true that AA has pyjamas in First and better linen but still: cabin is always a bit dirty food is pathetic for first class with $8 wines and cheap whisky. Service has improved a bit they try but far from being a real F experience. On arrival especially at GRU priority tags are just part of your luggage decor: I have lost count of how many times I had to wait much more than coach passengers for my bags.

Seat very old but comfortable and pitch was ok. Entertainment only through overhead screens. I was shocked that this aircraft had the new hatrack design only for premium cabins Economy cabin still had the 90's hatrack design which a) looks very old and b) does not have enough room for everyone. Only non-alcoholic drink service for this 2hr flight. Staff very unprofessional. There seems to be an inconsistency in their uniform. One female flight attendant was wearing - what seemed to be her personal apron that featured dozens of US flags next to each other. After landing in JFK we had to hold at a remote stand before our gate was available. As usual passengesr were standing up and retrieving their bags from the overhead bins despite the captain making an announcement to remain seated. No flight attendant took any action only a Captain in American Airlines uniform travelling as a passenger made assertive requests for everyone to remain seated to which everyone then complied. Also saw a male flight attendant making a call on his mobile phone during taxiing to the gate. Very unprofessional!,,,Economy,,5,4,1,1,1,,,3,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Maria Gritsch,United States,1/23/2014,Ghastly flight in First Class on AA from PVG to LAX. The flight attendants were very nice. The seat was horrible. Uncomfortable. Had really poor leather padding a very weird need to press a latch under the arm of the seat first in order to operate seat controls. When in the bed/sleep position the seat had a bulging ridge in the middle hinge that made it impossible to lie on. There was no privacy because the seats had no enclosures or partial walls just wide open so that all the lights noise smells of the cabin were omnipresent. Bad lighting tiny hard to move video screen dirty floor cheap broken plastic laminate console patched poorly with silicon putty etc. It was like a really bad business class. Actually I've flown several times in AA's sub marginal business class and as bad as they are the seat padding is actually superior to the first class seats. Guess anyone who tolerates this service has never flown Cathay Pacific. Their biz class is outstanding. Every seat with an aisle seats constructed to provide lots of privacy good lighting headphones mirror private cabinet lots of room really comfortable lie flat seat.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M Baughman,United States,1/20/2014,Based on a 3 day trip from BWI-DFW-SFO-ORD-BWI in first class I was pleasantly surprised and see AA as a much improved airline. Even though the first flight was cancelled due to a mechanical problem getting myself re-routed was painless though check in staff in BWI were not particularly helpful and if I did not have an app that showed me all my options I may not have had such a good experience. Two of the planes were new 737's FA's were attentive and friendly but still professional (shocking in a US airline). They tried to remember passengers' names and one gets the sense that AA is studying the premier international airlines. Food was fine but not memorable. The AA hubs I passed through all had their own personality but there was a consistency. DFW was friendly SFO professional and ORD a little gruff. The Admirals Club in each airport was good with very helpful professional staff. There is not much food or entertainment but that's not important to me in a domestic airport lounge. Reading other reviews I am reminded of my past experiences with AA and I am hopeful that my experience was a harbinger.,,,First Class,,8,4,4,4,4,,,5,1

Old CRT screens from the 90's hanging from the ceilings. Each one in the cabin had a different colour tinge. Meals were ok nothing to rave or complain about. Hostesses were surly with a bad attitude. Passenger next to my wife asked for a cup of coffee and my wife very politely asked for a cup of tea as well. Hostess snapped that she couldn't remember two things at once.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,J Johnson,United States,1/17/2014,Currently flying from Boston to Austin (via Dallas) on AA. Flights have been on time and aircraft condition is not bad. However we are flying with our 3 year old twins who are actually very good travelers and have found that AA is not family friendly at all. They do not offer any pre boarding for families with small children. We travel with carseats for the kids because we find that this keeps them calm and contained throughout the flight a benefit for all on board but this takes a few minutes for us to put into the seats when we get on the plane and is incredibly difficult to do with many other travelers simultaneously boarding. So when they oddly did not call families for pre boarding on this flight we went up to the front during one of the many other pre boarding categories (carrying our carseats and our tired kids walking) and asked if we could pre board. We were told that we could not that others had paid for this service and we would have to wait on the side. We waited as instructed and when we got on we found that most of the plane had somehow already boarded and it was extremely difficult to get set up. We got no offers of help from any staff members. This is the least family friendly airline we have ever flown hope we won't ever have to fly it again - we fly a lot even with the kids will try to avoid AA in the future. Also in flight entertainment was broken on our of our flights.,,,Economy,,4,3,1,3,1,,,3,0

No seat back screens and on the overhead screens the first film started before the crew handed out ear phones - they were too busy preparing their sleeping quarters. Food dismal and when I went to the galley to ask for some water I was told ""Wait 10 minutes and we will be round"". But the main issue was safety. No pre take off safety check and on landing 2 emergency exit rows I could see were full of luggage on the floor the occupants on one had ear phones in and their Ipads on window blinds were shut and all this less than 2 metres away from a steward.

Caution: if you assume that travelling Business means you can relax and board the last on this Madrid-Dallas route you are in for a huge shock. All overhead compartments designed last century are not capable of storing vertically standard 22"" hand carry and as a result they get filled quickly. Crew unhelpful preferring to watch the chaos instead of assisting. Entertainment is only provided by Samsung Galaxy distributed by the Crew but at least the headset is high end (BOSE). Food is the only consolation tasting above average. Did not check any luggage due to fear of losing it at DFW.

Inflight service in First Class seemed friendly enough however the food and beverage suffered by comparison with British Airways. AA serves Dewar's Scotch $20/litre BA Johnnie Walker Blue Label $200/litre. But certainly AA seats while older were lie-flat and comfortable in comparable pods. Where AA fails wretchedly is on the ground in baggage claim and in passing through security in Miami where there is no 'Fast Track' access to ongoing flights. For two years in a row despite flying International First Class with baggage checked and tagged 'Priority' by the international departure airport I waited nearly an hour for the bags in Miami with no American personnel in the baggage claim area to assist and no out source baggage company access to American computers. The result is that a missed or delayed international arriving bag must be reported outside customs and security to AA's baggage service office which does not have access to bags inside customs!,,,First Class,,2,5,3,2,2,,,2,0

First off Incheon Airport is a gem and it is easy access via express train from Seoul Station. On arrival at the check in we found a line that was moving along nicely. We arrived at the counter as a family of 3. I had a separate ticket as I was travelling back on a different date from my family. There was a hiccup with my ticket as they could not find the leg from DFW to AUS and we were travelling together. It took the check in lady quite a while to find it but we stood patiently as she was trying very hard. She finally had to give in and get a supervisor to help. All the while the other agents kept the line moving along and no one was stuck. The check in staff were all very apologetic and the supervisor finally found my ticket. She noticed that I am a Platinum level traveler and said that she would try to upgrade us all to Business Class. She was successful at it and we were given the upgrade. This made a huge difference as we were on our way home for Christmas and were not looking forward to that long flight in economy. The flight was 100% booked solid and not an empty seat was available. The staff were attentive and gracious. They went out of their way to ensure that our 12 year old son was comfortable and had plenty to eat and drink. Have to say that this was a very good experience from AA. Only drawback is that the entertainment system needs an upgrade.

That was delayed a few times then cancelled. Went back to the ticket counter where the agent put me on the next available flight Tuesday night (36 hours later). I asked to be routed through NYC but she said I had to deal with the ExPlt desk for that. After 2 hours on hold for the ExPlt desk (completely ridiculous but with the storm issues expected) I got a friendly agent who booked me on the 12.55pm to LGA then Tuesday flight to Chicago. YYZ-LGA flight an hour late with only 8 passengers aboard. Great flight attendants - lots of humor. Landed in LGA and went to AA desk to see if there was any flight leaving for ORD that night. Only one was scheduled (6 cancelled) and she got me a seat in coach - was very happy. At the boarding gate got my upgrade by an excellent gate agent who had a fun attitude in dealing with all the craziness at the gate. Good flight to ORD - had a nice squash gnocchi and salad.

I fly First and Business Class on airlines around the world and I don't have a problem at all with these Biz Class seats and amenities. Even though the seats are angled and not lie-flat I slept like a baby and found the different positions very comfortable. The IFE selection is minimal and not competitive with other airlines but it was decent for the 9.5 hr flight - besides meal time and sleeping took up a big chunk of the flight anyway. Dinner was good with the traditional AA sundae served at the end. This was an 11.10pm departure on an overnight flight so the meal time is odd but I was glad they offered full options. The crew were fine - your average run-of-the-mill crew who have been flying for 40+ years. They don't make any effort to make the Biz Class experience special.

We were then told that we would be taken to a hotel room for the night and rescheduled for the next day. The staff did not follow this up with any action and eventually we found out why. They had miraculously found a replacement crew so the flight was back on. Even then we were given the option of flying or staying in a hotel. By now the flight was 6 hours late.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,M Delancey,France,1/7/2014,CDG to JFK. Flight bought at the last minute at a very reasonable price. Of course you get what you pay for. The plane (B767) looks good from the outside (new painting). Inside it's so old that I can't even remember the last time I've been in such an outdated plane. The overhead compartments were so small that even my bag pack could not fit in. No need to talk about inflight entertainment as there's barely any. It's just a few central screens with two movies played. The funniest is that business class seats apparently don't have inflight entertainment either as before we landed the crew mentioned that they would be collecting portable devices in business class. The seat was of course quite worn out and not that comfortable. At least the food was not that bad. I expected much worse after boarding the plane. Maybe it's because it was made in CDG but the pasta I ordered were tasty (even though the portion could have been bigger). What struck me was how non existent the flight attendants were during the flight. They showed up to bring the main meal and the snack before arrival in JFK and that's about it. AA had reserved the last three seats of the plane for them. Two of the FA's spent the flight on those seats while the third one remained hidden behind the curtain in the galley. You didn't feel welcome to ask for refreshments during the flight. Anyway all in all American clearly offers a substandard product. The worst product I've seen I think is that of US Airways. I can't imagine what the merger of the two will produce.,,,Economy,,2,1,1,2,1,,,1,0

Booked flight for 6 including 2 children under 7 6 months ago. Online checks appeared to show a group of 6 seats allocated together. At check in for return flight we were told that no allocation had been made and that only 3 groups of 2 seats were available. I thought that seating for family groups were a prime consideration. How naive of me. Other airlines such as Virgin can manage this simple task! DFW to Reno leg used an old Mcdonnell Douglas 80. In each direction the family were placed right at the rear where the engine noise was fearsome throughout the trip.

American Airlines cancelled the flight without explanation and provided no alternatives. I scrambled to find a replacement flight on my own and got a seat on AA 919 from JFK to GRU the next day Jan 4 2013. I checked in more than 3 hours prior to the flight and went to the gate where staff were simply milling about. No boarding announcements until one of the American Airlines staff said that ""The plane (which had arrived a day earlier) was at the hanger"" when it should have been at the gate. Time of departure was pushed back 30 minutes then another 30 minutes then another 30 minutes and so on until it was 3 hrs late! As a result we could not go anywhere but had to stick around in case the flight suddenly started to board. When it was time to board the famous rudeness of American Airlines staff reared its head. The gate staff started barking at passengers about boarding the aircraft efficiently. The head of the cabin crew made a similarly rude announcement that passengers should take their seats quickly. The only saving grace was I finally asked for an upgrade and got one. Still even in a higher cabin the service was poor by notoriously grumpy flight attendants. We landed several hours late in GRU and had to wait a long time for ground staff to bring the moving bridge to the plane! The only reason I stay with American Airlines is for the frequent flier miles.",,,Business Class,,1,2,1,2,1,,,1,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,R Paterson,United States,1/3/2014,RDU-LHR return in Y. Outbound check-in and bag check handled smoothly no complaints. Boarding somewhat chaotic but this was mainly due to the layout of the gate area. Aircraft on this route are older 763s with no IFE but seats and toilets seemed in decent condition. Food decent enough and FAs - while not terribly friendly - were diligent about offering drinks. Entertainment was pretty miserable but what do you expect when you have no seatback system and have to rely on the overheads? Pretty laughable for an international leg. Return flight check- in at LHR was a breeze but boarding was infuriating! Pax with group 3/4 boarding passes rushing the gate during pre-boarding gate attendants barely speaking above a whisper when announcing boarding groups. Really ridiculous. FAs on return flight much friendlier. Main Cabin Extra proved worthwhile as the legroom was plentiful. All in all worth the competitive fare but not nearly at the standard of other nations' flag carriers.,,,Economy,,7,4,4,3,1,,,4,1

New 777 is great seats a little narrow but what can you expect? Flights to and from SJO on old 757s but crew made both flights quite enjoyable. If only JKF immigration would work a little better.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,N James,United States,1/3/2014,Recently landed from DFW-LAX-SFO. On my initial flight from DFW to SFO most things in comparison were fine however the quality of first class compared to Virgin is excessively disappointing. There were a lot more passengers in the first class then ever the FA was running around endlessly and even forgot to give us a cookie or even a snack with our drink. On the return trip the service was much better but did not offer any pre-flight beverages. On the last leg they even failed to grab my coat and hang it up for us. Overall Virgin America still has true First Class seats the new AA first class are more like business class with amenities. The food is quote mediocre but better then before.,,,First Class,,5,2,2,3,1,,,2,0
american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,S Daniels,United States,1/3/2014,AA hits a homerun with its new business class on the 777-300. They've entirely reinvented the AA business class experience with lie-flat seats in private pods. From JFK-LHR we experienced great food good service and restful sleep. It beats the business class of many quality European and Asian airlines - and is the best among US airlines. Nice to see AA investing in its product.,,,Business Class,,10,5,4,5,5,,,4,1

Well I was very pleasantly surprised. All my flights (GNV-MIA-IAD) were on time. The flight attendants were friendly and very professional.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,C OBryant,United States,12/30/2013,As noted in previous posts the American Airlines of today is in the midst of a steady decline. The AA of the 70's and 80's is now just a distant memory. This week I had my 17 year old on a flight from from ORF to DFW then to SGF. Easy connection and my son knows DFW very well and can get around pretty easily. While tracking the flight it was diverted to Charlotte. Reason was weather in DFW. Delay after delay now became a mechanical issue. So arrive DFW 2 hrs late. Needless to say he missed the connection and with Christmas there are no other seats the rest of the day until 9am the following morning. If I had not acted quickly and did some pleading with AA I was able to get him to XNA 7 hours late. So all in all AA is just nothing but a band of misfits and poor maintained aircraft. My son made it to XNA where a relative picked him up and delivered to SGF 2 hours away. Picked up bag next morning in SGF.,,,Economy,,2,2,3,2,2,,,2,0

The crew was great and the FC Senior FA was especially pleasant. AA's FC seating is very comfortable for Domestic flights and the seat recline version is a favorite of mine. I had pre-selected my dinner choice on line it was provided hot and tasty. Was hoping for a sundae but freshly baked cookies were served.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Chitre Ameya,United States,12/29/2013,ORD-LAS Return. My wife and I recently made this trip with some friends. The flight out to LAS was on an old livery S80. I was in seat 30D which meant the engines were right next to me and it was some extremely noisy 4 hours. The MD80 economy seat is not the most comfortable. ORD was under considerable snow that day and the de- icing truck broke down in front of our aircraft which delayed us going out. It was an extremely turbulent flight but the flight deck kept us in the loop the whole time. Flight back to ORD was on an old livery B738. Pushback was a few minutes ahead of schedule and overall a smooth flight until we got to ORD which was under snow again. This time we had a decent enough movie to watch and once again the flight deck was extremely interactive. Standard flight in terms of food and beverage. The FAs were smiling very welcoming warm and overall did a great job in taking care of the passengers.,,,Economy,,8,3,4,3,3,,,4,1

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Farouk Mogheth,Czech Republic,12/23/2013,Had reservations for San Francisco - Miami and later on Miami - New York La Guardia on my 3 weeks USA tour. The SFO-MIA flight started badly where all passengers were standing in a long line 5am in the morning with no open check in counters and self-check in unresponsive. Some passengers overheard AA staff state that the flight will be delayed however I saw that all was according to plan on all screens. Ground staff finally came and they denied any delays. Self check in either couldn't read the passport scans or simply loading into oblivion with an error message at the end. AA staff was more concerned only with payment for checked in baggage which for a non US passenger is considered unacceptable. Check in was chaotic to say the least and the First class counter looked even less organized. Only after everyone was checked in the flight jumped from 7am to 8am and in an hour the flight was delayed to 5.30pm! No explanation or apology. Only 1 agent handled the full flight rerouting people with onwards destinations but no interest in assisting any of the passengers who have Miami as their final stop. No apologies no assistance no accommodation no food for a 10 hours delay! The afternoon flight was boarded on time on an ancient B757 that seemed to still have technical problems as we learned from the crew. We stayed on the tarmac for another 90 minutes. Plane old and showing its age with interior from the 80s and an inaudible flickering screen leg room acceptable. Crew incredibly chatty amongst each other. Non visible cabin presence. Flight from Miami to New York as well an ageing 737-800. As they again charge for checked in bags all bring oversized bags onboard causing a less than civilized situation where there is NO space for all the bags thus delays in checking those bags and taking them out of the cabin. Again no food onboard for a long flight. Will never consider this airline.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

I was also satisfied with the unexpected angled flat bed business class seat on LAX-OGG-LAX flights in 767-300. Overall I was very happy with their service and products.

AA excel in two areas: 1) The super friendly hospitality of their Cabin Crew and 2) They provide meals that will fill you - their pizza prior to landing is sumptuous and most memorable. Their aircrafts are old and their IFE very ancient. So if price is a factor (especially when traveling with family) they will deliver satisfaction.

They refused because I supposedly got a special rate which was still more than double of the coach rate and I was not eligible for a refund.

american-airlines,American Airlines customer review,Davide Greco,Italy,12/11/2013,Flew ORD-MIA last week onboard AA1252. First remark: I got a reward ticket using my AAdvantage points and I must say that contrary to what happens with many other carriers a free ticket with AA is really a free ticket as I paid only 2USD for taxes and that's something I really appreciate. Flying AA is a very basic experience though: plane was a B767-300 freshly re-painted but about 20 years old even if the seat comfort is okay for a 3hour flight. No entertainment just scattered small screens and no meal provided for free just drinks. Having to pay USD 25 for checking your bag is something I really do not understand but it is a general policy of US carriers. Crew professional and quite friendly and a very talkative captain. Left and arrived on time with no mechanical problems happened as in the 50% of the AA flights I had flown in the past (total-10) so no complaints at all this time and I will consider to fly with them again for domestic flights in the future.,,,Economy,,6,3,3,2,2,,,5,0

This is a trip we have given her every year for the past 10+ years. But from check-in at JFK - the AA agents were rude and gave the impression as if we weren't worth the time. The trip began at 3am since her flight was scheduled to depart at 5.40am - I personally booked her round trip ticket and re-confirmed the requests for wheelchair service an aisle seat and extra legroom days in advance. None of these requests were listed on her reservation and when we asked the agent if she could try to accommodate in any way we were give very abrupt and snide no's. The wheelchair took 20 minutes to come. Baggage clerks - instead of checking her bags and placing them on the conveyor we were told that she had to carry them to the gate and place them on the conveyor herself as ""they aren't paid to do so"". Her transfer in MIA was exactly the same - no wheelchair assistance listed on the system and in order to make her connecting flight my Grandma had to walk a distance - from her arrival gate to the departure gate.

ORD-DUS 767-300 - the flight attendant was the only let-down: she was friendly but wasn't too attentive and talked with other passengers about how she didn't like flying long haul and was at her tolerance limit after a 7-hour flight. If you don't like long-haul then don't work it - ridiculous. Food was good - I pre-ordered it online and that worked well. Purser was very friendly. Arrived 45 min ahead of schedule and did the easy connection to Air Berlin Q-400 to Florence. Nice flight and on-time. DUS-ORD 767-300. Great flight attendant - friendly and attentive without being too in-your- face. Good food pre-ordered again online.

The AA representative has claimed that it is because of weather which was impossible to believe as practically all the flights to New England had been on time. We realized lately that they canceled it due to small amount of passengers.

I arrived at the airport to self check in for my boarding pass because I couldn't print online due to the change. There was one person servicing people for ""self- check in"" in one line. So if people needed to check bags they were in the same line as those who did not need to check bags and only needed to get to the kiosk to obtain the boarding pass. An American employee should have been there to redirect people who needed only boarding passes and have separate lines. I stood in line for 30 minutes to get to the kiosk and obtain my boarding pass with no bags to check. Service attendant appeared incompetent to other customers ahead of me. The service was very slow with no pleasant smiling faces. Further I learned when I got to the gate that Flight 1202 again delayed another hour for 1 pm. Then I receive a voicemail that the flight again delayed until 5 pm and that I would arrive in Dallas 10.10 pm not to arrive in CT until Thursday at 12 noon. That was also not guaranteed. I needed to be in Hartford CT by 8 am. Hence why I scheduled the flight for early morning departure the day before. While I received a refund I didn't make my conference.

The flight in itself was nice, both legs were short but I was more comfortable with the older 757-200 seats from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas but they were quite similar, since they were both short flights. There was no meal service but a choice of pretzels or nuts or biscuits and the attendants were allowing us to have more than one thing.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,S Quei,United States,7/31/2015,"The original reservation was SJC–ATL–BCN. Delta later modified my outbound flight and added a SEA stop between SJC and ATL, which added several hours to an already long trip, and this is the low point of my experience. SEA-ATL flight was delayed by 3 hours, and gate agents got us pizza and soft drinks, and alcohol was free during that delayed flight (delays happen, and these gate agents and FA's looked after us very well). Home-bound, ATL-SJC flight arrived 25 mins late. The other 3 flights were on time and uneventful. The check-in, gate, and onboard staff were friendly and efficient. I was surprised to be offered 3 choices for dinner on transatlantic flights, as well as a small mid-flight snack on BCN–ATL flight in economy class. Flight attendants were present through the flight. Seat-back screens provided great options for individual entertainment. The extra leg-room, boarding priority, and premium drink, are well worth the cost of a Comfort+ seat. I wish seats were wider but this is true of every airline I've flown in economy class. Luggage arrived on time. I will recommend this airline for international flights.

Delta agent in PAP was very helpful and put me on the flight I asked for, then Delta bumped me up to Business (Delta One). The new Delta BC with lie flat seat is really good. Window seats are even isolated (no passenger on the side). It is surrounded by the next seat which makes it a rather personal space. Having typically a low expectation of American carriers, the upgraded Delta BC is surprisingly good. Dinner is simple and well presented, service is quick and just what you need for a 7-8 hours flight. Connecting flight was slightly delayed but transit in ATL, is actually relatively easy and straight forward (from flight A to B in less than 15 min). I know it's no Asian carrier quality, but it is definitely changing my perception of US carrier and Delta seems on the right track to lift up its service. Will probably fly them again. Only negative point is arriving late in MIA there are hardly any Delta agents around (It's an AA airport!), so rebooking and hotel accommodation was tricky to figure.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Rosemary Westgarth,United Kingdom,7/21/2015,"We'd already flown Delta NYC to Nashville and were happy with it for shorter flights. However we were unhappy with business class Atlanta to London. It was either stiflingly hot or freezing cold. The seats were meant to lie flat and the advertising shows a woman lying on her side on the flattened seat. Interestingly she is a petite woman as anyone of average size would only be able to lie on their back when the seats are reclined as the legs are enclosed by the seat in front. My husband (who luckily likes to sleep on his back) and I swapped seats half way through as my seat was faulty and would not recline at all but I was still unable to sleep because of the seat configuration. I am a woman of average size. When my husband took it over he fiddled to see if he could get it a bit better and succeeded in releasing the leg rest which then became stuck so he spent the rest of the flight bolt upright with semi-raised legs even for landing! The two younger female flight attendants were pleasant and tried to help but the older chief stewardess for Business was curt and initially asked me what I had done to the seat! As there were no spare seats in business and no first class section she was unable to re-seat me. They tried manually fixing it and re-setting the seat, remotely, electronically but didn't return to see if it had worked - I had to call them again - and and finally (after 30 minutes of wrangling with it) the head stewardess said the magic words ""sorry about this"" (the one and only apology). Really she couldn't have cared less and when she handed out mints at the end of the flight she didn't ask how it had gone or apologise again. The food was very poor for business class (compared to BA for instance) and my husband's gluten free food was functional mainly consisting of fruit especially melon though his chicken main course was actually better than my standard meal. Breakfast consisted of granola (so sweet it was horrible) or eggs and he got a dry bread roll which was unheated (most gluten free bread is only palatable when heated) and a very poor quality gf sausage. There is such a huge range of gluten free foods now that it seems as if the airline's caterers are just not trying. Food was certainly no better than economy and fell short of Virgin Premium Economy which we flew out with.

No matter who's fault it was the point is they obviously can't communicate and manage the airline effectively. Pathetic customer is service - it consisted of blaming the tower and pushing back the departure time every 15 minutes with full confidence that it would leave then. Well, it didn't.

Check-in was done via the Fly Delta app and was simple enough, paid an extra £50 for exit row seats which I am conflicted about. On the one hand, a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck, on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp. They were very loud, boisterous and actually downright rude but the excellent crew put a quick stop to their antics once they were on the plane. Otherwise there were no delays. The flight itself was exemplary, the staff were attentive and wonderful. The entertainment system is well-stocked and of good quality, I also loved the genuinely entertaining and funny safety video.

Boarding was efficient in AUS and it was a nice touch to be addressed by name. Boarding efficient and flight left on time. It was also nice to be offered a pre flight beverage, chose white wine served in a plastic cup. The first class bulkhead seats we had were spacious. Embraer 175s do not have ovens so lunch was a cold chicken orzo salad with an appetizer and desert served all at once. Many reviews indicate that crew was either rude or inattentive but my experience wasn't like that. The drinks were kept filled during the flight, food ample and tasty and the flight attendants were upbeat and social. Boarding in LAX was a mess as the gate was in the corner and no one listens when they tell you they board by zone. Once on board a pre flight beverage was offered and after take off they served dinner. On the LAX to SEA route, Delta has partnered with Luvo as part of upgrading food service in first class.

Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad, sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch, it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant. My companion had the ginger beef and I had rice with shrimp and sausage. Again a slightly stuffy attendant but nothing to get into a fuss about. Seats had ample space and the aircraft, though a bit old but was clean. One negative thing that was consistent on both the AUS-LAX-SEA and SEA-MSP-AUS flight was trash in the seat pockets.

I selected the economy comfort seats and found them to be very nice and the legroom more than I expected. What was interesting how the cabin was separated though not with a divider so it felt very exclusive. In addition, there was a blanket and headset for watching the back seat TV. We received other snacks as well as the other normal offerings. One thing that can be said is Delta is trying to improve its service and the fact that they still offer some type of snack with your drink is better than what you get from American and United.",Boeing 767-300,FamilyLeisure,Economy,Atlanta to Auckland via Los Angeles,9,5,4,4,4,4,,4,1

We were the last ones to board and by the time we got to the entrance, my bag was automatically taken to be sent with the rest of the cargo because the flight was full and there was no space. When I check the cabins inside, I saw spaces available. The crew/staff didn't even check to see if there was space which proves how unprofessional this airline is. I paid for my ticket and only brought this bag. The crew were also unprofessional and tried to argue the fact that once the bag is checked that there was nothing for them to do and that's how things are.

I always find the staff helpful and pleasant, both ground and cabin staff. My recent flight had a routing DSM/MSP/JFK/LHR. On arrival at MSP I realized that my connecting flight to JFK was delayed, making the JFK connection impossible. When I explained my dilemma to a very helpful Delta employee in the Delta Club room she immediately worked on getting both me and my luggage onto the MSP/LHR service. An ontime boarding took place and I was greeted with a smile by the cabin services manager. Once airborne dinner was served (a very reasonable meal) promptly allowing the maximum time for sleep. We arrived into LHR on time and I cleared immigration and customs in a little over 30 minutes from touchdown.

They took all 4 of my family's bags and rudely told us they would arrive in SLC our final destination. A diff Attendant handed me 2 baggage labels.

Very short and acted annoyed that they had to give us directions to catch the new later connection. We arrived at the new gate to more Very rude Delta staff. Our tickets said not assigned so I stood in line at the gate to find out our new seats. When I approached the Delta staff I was told to sit down she was working on assigning seats (several passengers missed the connection). I tried to request that seats together because we were traveling with children on a 5 hour flight. She firmly told me to sit down. I felt like an idiot. They put us on the very back row with seats that partially reclined. Let's just say it was a long 5hours. After arriving in SLC 3hours later at midnight, only 3 out of the 4 bags that the rushing flight attendant took from us in the aisle arrived.

When we arrived at Atlanta to switch to our next flight we had missed our flight.

So someone comes to shut it and then we go out to runway. Then we have to wait another 13 minutes. Not able to rebook me for reasons that were also very vague. The flight was overpriced and didn't event accomplish it's intended purpose to get people where they need to be on time. As a business traveller this is absolutely unacceptable.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,A Bastien,United States,5/20/2015,5/9/15 SLC-SMF Airbus A320. My spouse let me sit in her first class seat. It was a disappointment: legroom not much better than Economy Comfort although the seat was wider and had more recline. The food was also disappointing same snacks as the ones given to Economy Comfort passengers. On the positive side the FA brought me a glass of wine when requested unlike my main cabin experiences in which FAs will not bring me a small bottle for wine (even if purchased) until the beverage cart makes its rounds. I didn't pay for this first class travel but if I had I would have been even more disappointed. My trip satisfaction is less than it was for my Economy Comfort flights because first class failed to meet my expectations. I rated entertainment as 1 because there wasn't any.,,,First Class,,2,4,4,1,1,,,1,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,R Knecht,United States,5/20/2015,LAX-JFK-KEF return Comfort + on all four segments. The Sky Priority boarding and extra legroom were a real plus but the DL Comfort + seating does not compare to BA Premium Economy. The Levo wraps and frozen yoghurt bars on the two transcontinental flights were 100 times better than the coach dinner and lunch served on the two international segments. Appreciated the open bar on all four flights but not the wine from a box on JFK-KEF. The cabin crews were friendly and professional on all four flights and there was no wait for luggage in either KEF or LAX. The ancient 767 on the final JFK-LAX leg was too warm had poor ventilation and the VOD lacked the live Dish TV option. Boarding for JFK-LAX was chaotic.,,,Economy,,7,4,5,3,3,,,4,1

I was seated in an aisle seat next to the emergency exit plenty of legroom possibly the most comfortable seat I've been on (having only flown economy). The snacks and drinks were fine the cabin crew were attentive. However it is simply wrong that you cannot use the entertainment system during take-off and landing.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,L Lander,United Kingdom,5/12/2015,On 28 April 2015 my friend and I travelled from Fort Lauderdale Florida to Atlanta Georgia for our connecting flight to Manchester England UK. Due to storms in Florida our flight was delayed by an hour. Despite the pilot's best efforts we arrived at Atlanta B24 35 mins before our flight to England was due to take off. After running as fast as we could we arrived at the check-in desk 10 mins before the Virgin plane was due to depart (the airline was aware of the Florida delay). Despite the best efforts of all the personnel on duty they were unable to get us on the plane. Nevertheless not only did the staff stay with us to locate our baggage at B24 but tried and succeeded to get us on another plane to depart that night. Staff not only located our baggage but ensured it would be put on the new flight.

The least passengers should expect from an airline is a seat that is not torn and filthy a plane that leaves on time and that arrives on one piece. Fine the flight did those things but are we supposed to be impressed? The plane was packed and tiny. No room for hand luggage for many passengers. Old plane - I mean really old. No movies or Ipads. Somewhat encouraged by the Wifi on board until we discovered you had to pay for it and it did not work well anyway. Business class looked like economy class five to seven years ago. Seats were small and do not get me started on the pitch. Dilapidated and depressing two other words starting with ""D"". Delta needs a makeover.

From the time of check-in the Delta staff were nothing but extremely helpful and obliging making the process super quick and easy. The flight itself was fantastic - unlimited drinks/alcohol (I had three very generous servings of red wine) and ample food. Hot towels were handed out at the beginning and end of the service while two meals were served during the 11-hour flight. If we required more drinks or food the staff were more than happy to oblige. The in-flight entertainment was also top notch - wonderfully wide selection of television shows and films. All in all a very pleasant experience - can't say the same for the subsequent LA > Vegas leg of the journey so will be sticking with Delta for intercontinental flights!,,,Economy,,9,4,5,5,5,,,5,1

Rude disinterested crew barely greeted the boarding passengers. Same ancient 757 with fairly comfortable lie flat seating. Were served an awful breakfast at midnight instead of dinner with no explanations. Then crew gathered in the front galley screaming and laughing bothering paying J class passengers that were trying to sleep. One of the pilots occupied seat 1A beside me without even saying hello.

Seat on the 767 worked fine if slowly and the flat bed was comfortable. This was enhanced by the excellent Westin pillow and duvet. The most comfortable pillow of any airline I have flown with. Food was excellent well presented and flavourful. Cabin crew were pleasant attentive and polite. The only bad thing I can report was the IFE system. It took five or maybe six attempts to make it work and the selection of movies was extremely limited. The small screen was not of great quality either.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,W Rongu,United States,4/14/2015,I flew Business on an international flight aboard 767-300. The experience in the Business class is probably one of the worst due to the layout of the cabin. The Galley is in the front and in order for the flight attendants to service the plane down to the middle of the standard economy class they must go through the Business class cabin to reach the areas to the back. On other airlines such as ANA they have an extra Galley behind the Business and Premium Economy class seats so that there may be a separation in service and noise. The design of the seating arrangement in the Business class is much tighter in the Delta with its bulky boxy full-flat system that the flight attendants' hard foot steps with their high-heels can be felt bouncing through the walls of the full-flat system. What kind of flooring did they use in the aisle? Why do the horrible footsteps and cart sounds transmit so much to the boxy seat system? I could not rest quietly or comfortably as the massive loud obnoxious footsteps of passengers and flight attendants alike can be felt all throughout the flight. No courtesy there obviously no company policy there obviously to make the flight attendants wear something more quiet on their feet or to be more considerate when running down the aisle! The temperature control of the full-flat system is lacking. The seats themselves feel fine but they become very hot after a while and there is no air around the seat or your feet so there is no way to cool down. The attitude of the flight attendants is about what you would expect from a classless American transport company fairly lacking in manners and they treat you as if you're on a flying bus (as they have always done). The Flight Safety video is a joke as they intended it to be but it certainly doesn't make anybody feel safe as nobody remembers the actual safety bits but remembers the comedy bits! A total waste of time and energy and most certainly conveys what I said earlier about the attitude of the airline. It feels like a cheap low-class flying commuter bus service and they'll treat you like that.,,,Business Class,,2,2,2,2,3,,,2,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,David Kaiser,United States,4/14/2015,"My wife and I returned to Boston on Saturday from my son's wedding in New Orleans. I had booked Delta to and from New Orleans changing at Atlanta. On the way down a problem emerged. My wife generally signs everything Patti instead of Patricia. I had made the reservation for her for Patti as I always do. A TSA guy decided to make an issue of the difference between Patti (on the boarding pass) and Patricia (on her license) and sent her back to the Delta counter. They changed the boarding pass and all was well. We reached the airport in plenty of time Saturday morning in NO and tried to get everything done at curbside check-in. I got my boarding pass but the machine refused to give out hers. The guy checked the bag and turned us over to a Delta guy walking the floor inside. He put us in a large line for ""special problems."" Since at this time there was about an hour before boarding we weren't worried. However Delta was woefully understaffed the line moved with glacial speed. With about 20 minutes to departure my wife told me to board to make sure at least one of us got home and I did. Meanwhile I was in touch with my wife via cell she had finally reached the end of the line. They told her she was too late to make the plane. They told her she would be on the next flight to Atlanta and there was 20 minutes between its landing and our Boston flight departing so she might make it. Her seat of course had been given away. It turned out the name confusion was an issue again. I will never fly Delta again if I can possibly avoid it.",,,Economy,,,4,1,2,1,,,1,0

First flight was largely uneventful the seats were what I expected food was nothing special and IFE was great. The lounge in NRT though needs an upgrade in terms of F&B. A lot of other airlines have more than just small bowls of whatever they're serving. (At least there were showers). NRT-SIN was normal and like the previous flight. The return was similar aside from the fact that Delta actually listened to customer feedback and pushed the departure time from 6 to 7am.

Flight was full but the services offered were very good and efficient we were offered a complimentary meal and a snack during the flight along with beverages. Flight attendants were very nice and polite however a couple of them were miserable and rude and towards the end of flight they lost interest and almost threw the coffee at us. We were happy to get off the flight it was very uncomfortable. JFK-LHR B767-300 - Our inbound sector was much better we paid to upgrade into economy comfort with exits seats which also meant priority boarding. Seats were not the greatest but legroom was huge and better for my partner. Flight was a night flight and it was very quiet and almost empty flight attendants polite and services offered again were very good. Both aircraft each way were ageing but at least they got us to our destination. I noticed Call bells were not answered and were left for hours. In flight entertainment was good new films offered for free along with games and TV shows.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Tait Steve,United States,3/28/2015,Flew Business from BOS to AMS in late February. The newly configured Business cabin on the A330 is now my favorite on any airline or any plane. Very comfortable seat/lie flat bed and personal space. I was traveling with my husband and unlike many other configurations the two middle seats allow two passengers traveling together to actually be together. The food and wine are excellent as usual and the IFE is industry leading. Let me not forget to praise the huge monitor for the IFE. Much larger than other airline's. Delta Business is my preferred airline for international travel. The only areas where they fall a bit short are in the crew professionalism at times. For instance on this flight I was never referred to by name which is just lazy. I just have one other comment and that is I wish they didn't serve a bag of spiced nuts with the first cocktail and instead served something like hot nuts or chips in a dish instead of a bag. Just a little thing but the only are a that isn't top-notch.,,,Business Class,,9,5,4,5,5,,,5,1

They boarded basically by two zones after all the preferred boarding for the first/frequent flyer/credit card holders etc. I'm not a fan of the zones as you're always stuck behind someone but at least they turned back people who tried boarding out of their group. They advertise the flight with seatback entertainment on their site but I noticed after booking they often switch to a plane with dropdown monitors. On this flight it switched to an aircraft with dropdowns which actually was not as bad as I thought but not thrilled with how they do that. The overhead monitor showed the latest 'Hunger Games' movie and then the 'Minions' movie which is as good as I would have got with Live TV on the seatbacks. The monitors seem to be every 3/4 rows. They gave nuts/pretzels out twice during the flight which is not bad for legacy carrier and drinks twice. Price was comparable/just below other offerings and at the most convenient times. It arrived early to LAX and had no wait on takeoff due to mid-morning time slot. Middle seat of my row was empty with aided in comfort. 8/10.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,3,4,,,4,1

Turned around and happened to see on the reader board along the wall (not behind the gate) that there was a gate change. No announcement was ever made in that terminal that the gate had changed and there was no announcement with out names to go to the gate. It was moved from B28 to B3 literally as far apart as you could get from each other. By the time we got to B3 the door had closed. We found a ""red coat"" employee across the hall. She made it seem like we were idiots and there would have been announcements made. She put us on Stand By from Atlanta to Salt Lake City we had 3 shots to get on one of the flights. However it is spring break and Salt Lake is a huge destination point all flights were oversold and had 30+ people on standby for each flight. In the hustle to get from one location to the other and going to 3 different terminals we saw numerous reader boards that indicated gate changes and while sitting in those 3 different terminals we never heard one announcement for any gate change on a Delta flight.

As I sit and wait for these flights they are all overbooked by at least 15 seats and I have had several agents act that I am an annoyance when I asked to be put on standby.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,E Berman,United States,3/9/2015,On March 1 2015 my flight from Phoenix to JFK (1247) was delayed due to icy conditions in New York. My 2pm flight finally took off at 4pm. When we were an hour from our destination the pilot informed us that management was diverting our plane to Detroit. We were told that agents would be waiting for us at the arrival gate and would answer all our questions. The agents turned out to be one very disinterested agent who was talking on his cell phone when we arrived and only told us where to go for re-ticketing when prodded. He sent us to gate A53 that already had a line of 150 people when those of us in the back of our plane got there. There was a lone agent to answer all our questions and re-book each person individually. After 1 hour in line we hadn't moved at all. There were no announcements no accommodations no compassion or concern for your customers. No food no pillows no answers! Many of us had family back at JFK waiting for us and we had no information to give. That none of the 1200 people that were diverted lost it is a testament to OUR understanding and patience. Clearly the understanding was one-sided. No one blamed the inconvenience on the airline after all weather happens. What we objected to was the total ineptitude and lack of compassion of the Delta personnel. Eventually a fellow came around with one slice of pizza but I found out about that by roaming the gates looking for information. Most of us slept on the floor as there were no cots or sleeping bags given as an option. It is disappointing that Delta couldn't do better. Eventually some of us received a $100 voucher by insisting on some compensation for our discomfort. I don't imagine I will make much use of it as Delta will be a last choice of airline for me.,,,Economy,,,3,1,2,3,,,4,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,M Bernstein,Canada,3/9/2015,Delta recently on a finally two class plane from YWG-MSP (CRJ-900) I believe. Total trip was YWG-MSP-LAS. I despise the United ERJ-145's and similar small product that was on international routes from YWG previously. Thank you to Delta for slightly upgrading the size of your planes out to MSP. Solid 757-300 economy plus to Las Vegas. Solid crew everything was nice and smooth. The 757 had been refurbished had a great AVOD system. Flights on time crew very friendly. I cannot ask for more on this route. It seems to me Delta is making a large effort to improve their customer service and technology and overall experience. It is working wonders it is amazing how far ahead Delta is of United (my other carrier to Las Vegas through DEN). My preferred US carrier.,,,Economy,,9,4,4,4,4,,,4,1

Given no explanation left standing in several queues for hours with refreshments only given hours later. When people in the queue started giving out as nobody had given any information or updates a Delta employee got the police. I'll go via Aer Lingus in future as I know they would not treat people like that. The flight return was maybe 15 euros cheaper but what a mistake it was.,,,Economy,,,3,2,3,3,,,1,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Calvin Watkins,United States,3/4/2015,I will never fly Delta again. My wife and I were scheduled to fly out of Atlanta to Wilmington and were made to check our carry on bags at the ramp 15 minutes later we were deplaned. We had just waited 45 minutes in the terminal for a flight crew. They board us and tell us weather stopped the flight. Don't insult our intelligence. That plane sat in my view for 4 hours and we were refused our luggage. 24 hours later no one at Delta knows where our bags are. We re-routed to OAJ customer service in Atlanta assured us they where re-routed. This was totally avoidable.,,,Economy,,,0,1,2,0,,,3,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,M D Sperry,United States,3/4/2015,In early August 2014 I booked a Business Elite ticket from STT to ATL for February 22 2015. My confirmation indicated my seat number and that a meal was included in my ticket. At check-in however I found that Delta had changed my status to Economy with a seat far back in the aircraft. When I called Delta to rectify the situation I and my Son-in-law were both treated rudely. We spent 2 hours on the phone with the result being that I should “ request to be upgraded at the airport. At the airport there was another 30 minute wait before I could talk to a Delta representative only to learn that I'd have to appeal at the boarding desk. A one hour wait ensued at the head of the line at the departure desk while the Delta representative ignored me waited on other people and fiddled with a computer terminal that wasn't working. The end result was the same rudeness and no help at all. I got neither the meal nor the priority baggage check-in that I had paid for. The flight was late arriving in ATL and I had to run to make my connecting flight to BOS. Delta had changed my seat assignment on this flight also. When I called to file a complaint the Delta Supervisor informed me that Delta changes aircraft seat assignments and passenger status without notifying passengers and confirmed that they had sold my assigned seats to more than one person and that these were normal”practices for Delta. I can't imagine why anyone would want to fly with Delta Airlines. Once they have your money they treat you like dirt or worse. There are plenty of other carriers out there. Based on this experience I can't see myself ever flying Delta again. I know I am not alone as there were at least 20 people in line behind me with similar complaints.,,,Economy,,,2,1,3,2,,,1,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,A Garry,United States,3/4/2015,Left at the airport in Jamaica for 7.5 hours only to be told the flight was cancelled. Now at 11pm we needed to find our luggage go through the process of finding hotel reservations along with 100 other passengers. The next direct flight home to NYC was in two days. The following morning Delta tells us that our flight leaves in 40 minutes. Now we need to pack and get to the airport fast. We flew business elite and it was so disturbing to find that the armrest was broken and that no wifi or TV. Our choice of meal was eggs or cereal? Should have gone coach. The flight was not cheap and expected more. Realizing now why Delta is not our normal choice of airlines.,,,Business Class,,,2,5,2,1,,,2,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,M Woods,United States,2/24/2015,SJU-JFK in Economy Comfort seats. Late night flight out of SJU. Crew were fine. Economy Comfort seats had adequate legroom - glad we paid for the extra room because regular coach seats looked like torture for tall people. In flight entertainment though was terrible. Tiny overhead movie screens. I thought Delta had all seat back video screens. I would have been really annoyed had I spent the money to sit in First - those seats were not so much better than Econ Comfort and the same tiny overhead movie screens every few rows. We were handed a tiny roll with some cheese and turkey and a Milky Way with the beverage service.

Dinner followed by as many sandwiches peanuts and pretzels as you can eat and as much as many beverages as you like all served with a smile both on request and on cabin pass throughs. Crew on this trip had seniority (I asked) and these were folks who understood the profession of customer service. Video on demand is top in class. A grade.

The positive point is I was upgraded to First Class on the US journey but this isn't worth it you only can drink whatever alcohol you like.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Brian Smith,Japan,2/18/2015,NRT-PDX-NRT in Premium Economy. I'm a frequent flyer with Delta but usually fly in business class. Going to Portland the food was far superior to the food on the return I'm certain it is because of the high level of catering here at NRT. On the return the amount of food was not good either and there was no food available in the galley. I had to beg to get peanuts and it seemed like I was getting a big favor from the FA (hello 10-hour flight no snack besides ice cream). The seat has enough legroom has a recline that doesn't interfere with the person behind you too much except for making the AV angle uncomfortable to watch for the one behind. Great AVOD which is Delta's selling point in economy. FAs pleasant but not overly so-just doing their job. The toilets were not cleaned throughout the flight. They were stocked with paper products but never once cleaned and trash was overflowing. It was bearable but not enjoyable overall. Hard to come down from business class with a lie-flat seat and good food.,,,Economy,,7,3,3,3,5,,,4,1

Very good experience small aircraft both legs but clean I was in Economy Comfort. Flight attendants very good with excellent customer service. From CVG to DFW the flight was delayed due maintenance but it was repaired and the flight went without any issues. Arriving in Dallas just some minutes late but the baggage service was very good and the bags were out quickly. My return flight was DFW to BOS via ATL January 29th also very good planes were full both legs. I didn't get economy comfort on DFW-ATL but paid $19 for a preferred seat I think it was not a good idea since got group 2 and almost didn't get space for my carry-on because group 1 passengers almost got it all. I think if you are paying something extra for a seat you should go on group 1 despite that the flight was very good and the flight attendants were ok.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Gerasenkov Andrey,United States,2/11/2015,LGA-BNA operated by Endeavour Air on Jan 30th. Aircraft - 2 week old CRJ900. Departed 2 hours late due to the plane arriving late and the crew attempting (unsuccessfully) to fix a broken overhead bin lock. Eventually they gave up and scotch-taped the bin cover so it wouldn't open during the flight. Otherwise the flight was uneventful and fairly comfortable. Snacks and soft drinks were distributed and the FA's were attentive. My return flight from BNA got cancelled due to LGA completely shutting down due to the winter storm on Feb 2nd so I got rerouted to JFK via ATL. The 40-minute flight from BNA to ATL was uneventful and was on a completely full 23.5 y.o. A320. No food or drink service on this short flight. The ATL-JFK eventually departed 3 hours late despite most other JFK-bound domestic flight cancelled. The MD88 was completely full which was understandable given that the three previous flights to JFK were cancelled that day. Despite its age the aircraft was comfortable and the flight smooth. Upon landing in JFK we had to wait another 1.5 hours on the taxiway for a gate to become available. Bottom line: Delta got me back home albeit 8 hours late but I think that's pretty good given the circumstances.,,,Economy,,6,3,4,0,0,,,0,1

Took a 6am flight so I was at the airport at around 4am but the staff was present and was able to lift my mood even without my morning coffee. Barely a wait for security or bag check. When I got to my gate the flight crew was already there and chatting with travellers. Boarding was quick. Unfortunately there was a slight delay due to 'mechanical failure' but I still arrived on time. FA were excellent with 3 drink services (I think) and offering coffee and water in-between. I slept about 1.5 hrs out of the three hour flight comfortably due to the lovely headrests that adjust in multiple ways. Didn't try to recline my chair however.,,,Economy,,10,4,5,5,0,,,5,1

My flight was scheduled to depart LAX at 9.40pm and I checked in at Delta's Priority counter around 8:00pm and proceeded quite quickly thru security and found my way to a very crowded SkyClub. When we boarded the aircraft I was pleased to discover that this plane was a newly converted B-767 with the new Business Elite product-proceeding to my seat my coat was stowed and I was served champagne in a champagne glass (so unlike American who still give you those tacky plastic cups) for a pre-flight drink. The seat was 4A and quite comfortable and reclined to a full lie flat bed a nice pillow and quilted blanket as well as an amenity kit. As soon as we were air borne I changed into pajamas and slept most of the way to JFK. The crew were quite keen to help as were the nice ladies in JFK SkyClub during my transit time for BDA. The JFK-BDA flight was also very pleasant although I slept on that one also. All in all a very nice experience with Delta on this route especially with the new Biz Elite product between LAX and JFK-will look forward to doing it again.,,,Business Class,,10,5,5,4,4,,,5,1

No seats unused. Even though I get airsick and need to be next to the window they refused to accommodate-even though I'd paid more for a window seat on the flight their delay made me miss. Then later delayed on the runway 4 hours-apparently because they were waiting for a manifest. The seats were just atrocious. I've flown economy all my life and never felt so uncomfortable.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,N Stepp,United States,1/23/2015,Columbus (CMH) to Managua Nicaragua and back. Personally I felt that Delta delivered an enjoyable experience and I would gladly travel with them again. 1) My initial flight from CMH to Atlanta went well. We left and arrived on time. The plane itself was clean and neat and seats were surprisingly comfortable although my shoulders could have used a little more room. Flight staff were courteous and even though we were on a booked flight I felt comfortable. 2) We experienced over a one hour delay from Atlanta to Managua and had to wait in the plane for about 45 minutes because of traffic over Florida (not Delta's fault). This plane was not nearly as nice as the first (no seat dividers) but the staff were friendly and the flight was still enjoyable. I flied in the Economy class upon my arriving flight. On the way from Managua to Columbus: 1) I flew in the business class cabin and was immediately greeted by friendly staff who were eager to give me whatever drink I desired. The seats were very comfortable and a delicious meal was served. The flight both left and arrived on time. 2) After arriving back in Atlanta we were greeted by an insanely long line to pass through customs. I don't know how much influence Delta had but I had a two hour lay over and just barely made it to my next flight. For the flight from Atlanta to Columbus I flew in the first class cabin which was surprisingly less comfortable than the business class one that I had been in previously. I slept for the majority of the time but was still given good customer service and the flight both left and arrived on time. After this experience I would recommend Delta but would suggest that you have at least a two hour layover to prevent any problems with connecting to another flight.,,,Economy,,8,4,5,4,3,,,5,1

The return trips to Houston 2014 in December and to Lagos in January 2015 were a totally different story. I flew economy on these flights. The seats were terribly uncomfortable (even though I was in economy comfort) and the conditions were deplorable. By the end of the flight bathrooms were indescribable!

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,N Hartmann,United States,1/19/2015,We flew TUS-ATL-EVV on the way EVV-DTW-ATL-TUS on the way back. We have two kids and traveling is not always easy. But Delta did a fine job of making things smoother for us by letting us board early and treating our kids very well. (They seem to be the only airline that still gives kids their wings). We were delayed getting out of DTW and the pilots openly made an effort to get us to ATL on time recognizing that people had connections to make. They were true to their word taking a shortcut and flying at a higher speed and we arrived in ATL 10 minutes later rather than the 30-40 we expected. The MD-90 we flew between TUS and ATL was brand-new inside and we were impressed by the service we received from the crew. The fact that you get a drink and a snack is nice I know people that fly Delta just for the Biscoff cookies. The planes are for the most in great condition though the Airbus 320 we flew had a few loose tray tables and could stand to be updated. I've been pretty dissatisfied with American airlines except for Southwest but Delta trumps all of them in terms of flight quality service and passenger dedication.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,S Browning,United States,1/19/2015,Connecting flight was boarding when my first flight was landing. Agent at the desk said she would call through but I had to get from one end of the airport to the other. I am an older person and went as fast as I could. My mouth went sandpaper dry and I felt quite faint only to arrive at the next flight to find the gate closed! It was Deltas fault I was late there should have been plenty of time between flights if they hadn't delayed so long leaving a small airport initially that didn't have a line up of flights going out. They spent too much time deciding whether or not to de-ice the plane! I'm glad they were careful and did it but could have got the job done a lot faster and got the flight in on time. As the plane for my next flight was still there I begged the agent at the adjacent gate to allow me to board as I couldn't spend the night and next morning in Minneapolis waiting for a flight to Newark. Fortunately she co-operated called through and they opened the door to let me on. I felt the stewardess was unfriendly as I boarded the plane probably thinking I should have been there on time. I think in situations like this there should be some pick up at the gate to get you to the next flight without having to nearly make yourself sick to get there and following flights should wait for all booked passengers making connections when Delta has caused the delay. This might have been a one off situation. I usually have found Delta friendly and helpful as the agent was who helped me to get on my flight.,,,Economy,,7,5,5,5,5,,,5,1

To make matters worse since half the flight must have ordered the same special meal none of which was opened or eaten by any passenger the flight crew then proceeded to open each sealed package and throw out the fruit so that they could retrieve their special cheap Delta plates for later use. I personally witnessed at least 20 such meals being discarded. I regret having had to use Delta on this trip after having managed to avoid it for so many years.,,,Economy,,3,3,1,1,3,,,1,0

The priority level ticket agent was not able to find the ticket for our lap child wasting 45 minutes of our time at check-in. When it was finally found on their system they were not able to print it for us. Just very frustrating and stressful. The business class on Delta is laughable. Lets see drop down screens from the ceiling no different than they had in the 1980s. The movie didn't even work on the return flight. Food quality I wouldn't even feed to my dogs.

Our return flight from Paris to Minneapolis was delayed and therefore we had to rush to our connecting flight. Little did we know how far apart the terminals were. Delta staff should have informed us of the distance and offered a passenger trolley. It turned out that as we arrived at our departure gate the information board said ""Boarding"" however the Delta staff person would not let us board. While we waited at least 10 minutes for a supervisor we watched the information change from ""Boarding"" to ""Closed"" and we watched our plane depart without us (along with another passenger in our circumstances). We were booked on another flight seven hours later meal vouchers were denied as we waited the seven hours we saw instances (more than one) where other passengers were allowed to board after the ""Closed"" sign was on. Delta staff were not prepared to assist us in any way nor did they appear to be trained in customer service. This is just one issue albeit the biggest one that we had with Delta personnel giving incorrect information being rude (not the FA - this was all with the staff at the various airports we dealt with).

Now Delta does not allow seat selection with economy class fares. My company do not allow class upgrades which means I'll forever be the really tall guy stuck in a middle bulkhead seat if I fly Delta. Old planes with no power no in-flight entertainment (it never fails to amaze me how many ancient CRT televisions are still mounted to the roof of Delta cabins). On longer flights Delta refuses to stock enough food to meet the demand of passengers towards the back of the plane. Sure I can survive a 6 hour flight with nothing but peanuts and pretzels but why? The only positive thing I can say about Delta is to give a kudos to the majority of attendants that are willing to put up with grouchy passengers and restrictive rules. The ones that maintain a positive attitude deserve an award.",,,Economy,,1,1,3,2,1,,,1,0

Booked flight 6 months in advance (and got a great deal) but over the next four months our flight itinerary was changed six times. Since some of the changes impacted our flight by over an hour I called to change to other flights - agents were happy to help out and they answer their phones promptly - a pleasant change compared to the waits we usually experience with our regular airline Air Canada. Alerted by email of all but one of the changes which I noticed by accident. We had paid extra for Comfort Economy and one of the changes meant that the fee for Comfort Economy was higher - instead of notifying us that we needed to pay an extra $20 to keep our Comfort Economy seats they just put us in a regular Economy seat and kept the $130 we'd paid to begin with! Thank goodness I noticed. Flights themselves were good. The extra leg room on the long haul flight was wonderful. Wide selection of entertainment. Plenty of food/drink offered and quality not bad (daytime hot meals ok mid flight snack fine breakfast awful). Service attentive. Very cheerful on the way there and pleasant on the return flight.

Unfortunately the cabin crew on the return flight was borderline lazy doing the minimum and spending more time socializing on the back of the aircraft than paying attention to the passenger and especially the cleanliness of the bathrooms.,,,Economy,,6,3,3,4,5,,,3,1

Food was ok. Nothing special. Seats are great - I'm tall and they do the trick. VOD system is outdated and flight tracker rarely works. The return flight was about an hour late and the crew was much better. Food from JNB was much better than first flight. I would rate the second crew as outstanding.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,S Baker,United States,1/5/2015,We flew Delta Airlines 777 business class from LAX to Bangkok (via Narita) in October 2014. The seating configuration is one of the best we have seen internationally. The lie flat seats were enhanced with two pillows and a comforter. The second/smaller pillow worked very well for your legs/knees over the long flight. The comforter was the most enjoyable blanket we have ever experienced on an international trip. It's amazing that such a small difference in quality can make such a large difference in the sleeping comfort and environment. The only complaint about the seat configuration is that it is difficult to communicate with a traveling partner.,,,Business Class,,10,5,5,4,5,,,5,1

Seats on both flights were uncomfortable with minimal recline. The headrest pushes my head forward making it difficult for me to nap. On both flights I forgot to bring my seat to the upright position for landing. The FAs didn't notice or might have figured it didn't make any difference. I would not pay to fly Delta in economy or EC on account of the uncomfortable seats. I traveled on a free ticket purchased by my spouse with FF miles so I gave Delta three stars for Value for Money. Food for purchase but items that appealed to me weren't available. The FAs were courteous the flight uneventful. However Delta is my least-favorite airline.,,,Premium Economy,,5,1,4,1,1,,,3,0

It was unfortunately delayed due to bad weather but the service on the flight definitely made up for this. Drinks peanuts and pretzels were offered soon after departing LAX and a healthy snack box filled with trail mix wholegrain crackers guacamole tomatoes celery and carrots was also provided. I did not expect this to be included in the price at all on such a short flight! After flying with another airline on a domestic US trip the service on Delta definitely stood out and I would definitely fly with them again.,,,Economy,,8,5,5,5,0,,,5,1

The PDX-AMS was good with the typical Delta service which has improved over the years. Aircraft was clean and a very good IFE. For the return flight it was quite different starting with a very disorganized Delta security at the gate. The contracted agent were borderline rude and did not have a clue what they were doing. During the flight the cabin crew appeared to do a minimal job and could care less about the service and especially the state of sanitary conditions of the restrooms.

Otherwise it's pretty much like other U.S. carriers. Food for purchase. I didn't buy any so rated it at one star. Charge for entertainment headphones didn't buy a set so I also rated entertainment at one star. I fly Delta only because my spouse has Platinum FF status and buys my tickets with her FF miles.

Seats were leather/plastic and not fabric and felt comfier than many others. Entertainment system was buggy and rebooted once as well as skipping/pausing throughout films. Food was bland but passable: chicken and rice meal with brownie bread and salad for dinner and a croissant with jam for breakfast (with orange juice). Service wasn't that friendly but also the announcements were amateurish with long pauses repeated interruptions and announcing the wrong arrival terminal before later correcting herself! I didn't know until this flight that seat changes within economy class can cost $40 each even if passengers on the same booking were placed in seats far away from each other on different rows (and the seat change was to bring them together).,,,Economy,,4,3,2,2,2,,,3,0

I am 6'2 and whilst normally I can find airline seats restricting this was the worst I have experienced. I can never before remember having to sit open legged as my knees do not fit in the seat when my legs are side by side including when using budget carriers. What's more the head restraint didn't stay in position making it doubly uncomfortable for a man of my height and despite the seat being in the middle of the plane there was no recline (not that there was any room to recline into). Food was ok drinks only served once despite it being almost a 10 hour flight and the entertainment system had only old movies and the TV box sets were missing random episodes meaning it was difficult to watch anything sequentially. Not a good advert for a Delta and will certainly bare this in mind when it comes to booking again in future.,,,Economy,,3,1,3,3,2,,,2,0

On all of the flights taken I was treated well by all staff check-in and in-flight. The airplanes were clean even the two short haul flights when the turnaround was very tight. Delta cabin staff are certainly the best by a long mile as compared with the other legacy airline staff in the USA. My flights were a combination of First (internally) and Business (Trans Atlantic). The food on the Trans Atlantic flight was pretty good. My only comment regarding the whole food and beverage service was that the red wine on the LHR/MSP leg was chilled. The equipment used for my Trans Atlantic flight was a 767-400ER which was comfortable (I prefer the Business seating in the 767 as opposed to the A330) and I managed to sleep for 4 hours east bound.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Jezrel Sabaduquia,United States,12/18/2014,JFK-ATL-AUS in F. Decided to pay First Class to try their product and Delta has done an excellent job revamping their JFK base. Check-in at the separate Sky Priority area was a top-notch experience it has a completely separate entrance and the area is cozy and classy complete with a seating area and little water bottles at the check in desks. Priority security line was a bonus since it was rush hour and the regular line was just insane. Priority boarding was strictly enforced which was good. Plane to Atlanta on a 757 equipped with the older transcontinental product. Seats were extremely plush and comfortable with great recline and legroom was excellent. Wouldn't mind sitting on those seats on a longer flight. I wish the leg rest would have extended higher though. Breakfast was served which was smoked salmon toasted bagel fresh fruit and yoghurt. I've read positive reviews about Delta's F catering and this was no exception. Everything was fresh presentation was excellent and quantity hit the spot nicely. My only major issue on this flight was the flight lead that served the first cabin he was a tad cold and didn't really interact with the passengers which I admire about US airlines. Service however was efficient and service calls and requests were all honored on a timely fashion. Entertainment system didn't work until half an hour before landing but it wasn't too much of an issue selections for movies shows and music were all great. ATL-AUS on an older 757 seats were huge and comfortable but legroom was limited but still sufficient. Flight attendants were more friendly however only snack options were available despite being a longer flight. Drinks and snacks were provided regularly and were of good quality. Overall Delta is serious about transforming itself as a global airline with a great reputation. All flights were on-time their hard product is reliable catering is excellent and even though I had some issues with service Delta still provided a great flight experience and would not hesitate to fly with them again.,,,First Class,,8,5,3,5,4,,,5,1
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,S Paolo,United States,12/18/2014,4/30/14 JFK-LHR was a pleasant experience (evening flight). The Delta Ground Crew were fine but had some issues with regards to an additional carry on item when the Airport Customs denied our entry towards the Immigration Area. Boarded on time on a B767-400ER. Seats felt tight with limited legroom but a very comfortable back rest. Ordered our meals online when booking however my meal was not available on the flight but it was fine to wait for the general food selection. Flight entertainment was excellent getting to watch the latest movie releases of the year. Flight Crew were well accommodated on this full flight. Land safely at LHR with a delay of 50 mins. 5/14/14 Return leg LHR-JFK was a disappointment. The older B767-300 aircraft had a rusty smell. Food selections we chose online were again unavailable. Flight crew were less friendly to passengers fewer smiles yet one of the FAs stood out very well in performance. The seats were a lot of worst with thinner padding making it extremely uncomfortable to lean your back all the way. The restrooms were awful unlike the first leg which was spotless. The same goes with the cleanliness of the cabins. Overall flying with Delta would mean riding old planes and comfort is less of a priority in economy class. Delta is my top choice when flying Domestically but definitely out of the box for international and long haul travel. Next time I travel to Europe BA goes next in the list.,,,Economy,,5,3,3,3,4,,,3,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Ronald Knight,Canada,12/10/2014,In March 2014 I booked a flight from San Diego to Vancouver BC. There was a one hour stop-over with plane change at LAX. Between that booking and the flight date of November 30th Delta made 6 changes/cancellations to this single reservation resulting in the change in planes being switched to Seattle with a 4 hour stop-over. When my flight arrived in Seattle a further one hour delay was announced. I asked the reason and was told that it was because of ice despite the fact that it was a sunny day with dry pavement everywhere and the plane was coming from Las Vegas. The clerk then mentioned that Delta did not offer compensation for weather-related delays. The lie about icing was confirmed by another clerk who checked in her computer and found the delay was really caused by mechanical failure. I then asked what compensation Delta would give me for a 5 hour stop-over involving dinner time. I was offered a chocolate bar. Delta is the last airline I would choose in the future.,,,Economy,,3,3,3,2,1,,,2,0

My carry-on was approximately 1 inch too wide due to my use of the one inch expansion zipper. So my option was to pay to have my bag checked or to use the other small duffle I had inside of my carry-on.

Checked in online and it took less than 5 minutes to get through DFW security on a Saturday morning. I was greeted by a friendly gate agent who smiled while welcoming me onboard - what a concept for a domestic airline these days. Onboard the FAs were equally pleasant with the First Class FA even offering to hang the coat of an Economy Class passenger. Snack choice consists of peanuts pretzels or Biscoff - while this isn't much it's still more than you get on any other domestic airline. First leg arrived nearly 20 minutes early and the transit in ATL was painless though keep in mind it is a very large airport if you have a tight connection. Boarding was delayed slightly on the second leg to RSW though we pushed back only a few minutes late and arrived 5 minutes early. This flight was not full and the FAs were once again cheerful while performing the beverage service (but only pretzels this time and no Biscoffs).

I didn't need the allowance of 3 checked bags up to 70 lbs for biz class to Brazil but it can be a plus. Service was good especially on the international legs.

The Economy Comfort seats on the Connection flights felt more comfortable. Delta provided a wide array of entertainment choices. I only fly Delta because my spouse buys my tickets with her frequent flyer miles. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights on account of the uncomfortable seats. Next time my spouse and I fly to Europe or Asia I will ask her to use her FF miles for flights on a Delta partner with better seats.,,,Premium Economy,,3,1,2,3,5,,,2,0

The blue vinyl seats on Delta were very uncomfortable had minimal legroom and recline the plastic armrests hurt my arms after an hour or so. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. Seats on Delta Connection were more comfortable. My one star rating is for the Delta seats. I didn't use the inflight entertainment system which appeared to have a good selection. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights. My spouse purchased my ticket with her frequent flyer miles. Next month when we fly from California to Florida I'll ask her to book our flight on a Delta partner if possible. The Delta seats are too uncomfortable for long haul flights.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Jean KirschSulllivan,United States,10/28/2014,"In September I flew Delta round trip Detroit - London - Detroit business elite class on planes with the lay-flat seats. Let's be honest and call them ""pods"" not seats. These plastic ""pods"" must be the most uncomfortable cramped seats ever designed for an airplane. I am only 5'1"" weigh 125# and even at that small size I felt wedged into a narrow hard space. Seats are narrow hard moulded vinyl and there is absolutely no room for anything. Couldn't even figure out where to store the provided quilt and pillow. Sit on it? Put it on the floor where it immediately becomes wedged under the seat or you have to walk on it to get out/in your seat? Fold out trays are tiny and almost useless as are the provided ""pockets"" (shallow moulded indents that won't even keep a bottle of water upright) for magazines books papers bottled water etc. Attempting to stand up or leave your seat is a major challenge. Apparently the expected protocol is to wedge yourself into the ""pod"" and not move for eight hours. Never again!",,,Business Class,,5,1,5,4,0,,,2,0

Found the service to be quite good food had a good variety and all meals were served hot. Also good idea about placing the snacks out for passengers to help themselves.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Mike Looney,Australia,10/22/2014,Worst business class I have ever travelled on. The product provided on my trip from LA to San Jose is nothing close to what is represented on the Delta website nor as described in their inflight magazine. We had expectations of lie flat beds on the last leg of our long journey from Melbourne (Australia) to San Jose Costa Rica. To make matters worse this last leg with Delta was an overnight flight - so we had been travelling in excess of 24hrs before boarding Delta. What a disappointment to find we were on possibly the oldest aircraft I have flown it had a 2 person bench seat format with an individual backrest that only slightly reclined. The inflight food service was lousy (very similar to an economy meal on a domestic flight). Then to top it off there was a Dog (yes a canine) sitting / sleeping in seat 1B right next to us! There was no insert entertainment system there was a very old box TV hanging from the ceiling in the aisle which from Seat 1D I couldn't quite see very well.,,,Business Class,,1,1,2,1,1,,,1,0

DL is working hard to be a serious airline and it's mostly paying off. All flights were on time and generally the service and food very good including a new beef enchilada (really!) lunch item that was excellent. The omelette breakfast out of LAS however- not so much. For me the biggest issue with DL is the age of the fleet. Both long legs were on vintage (25 years old plus) 757s with no modern amenities except pay for WIFI. These old ships showed their age throughout including (my pet peeve) dreadful bathrooms no entertainment whatsoever and old style overhead bins. The one flight with no first class section was aboard the dreaded CRJ200 for a 90 minute flight.. DL generously assigned seat 14A with a GE engine seemingly in the next seat. When will the airlines fulfil their promise of dumping these dogs altogether rather than just moving them from one fleet to another?

Noticed when I checked in the day before flight that return connection from Minneapolis to DSM had gone from 1 hour to 3+ hour layover. Just tried to change departure time from SFO to Minneapolis so flight would make more sense (1 hour layover). Said they would be happy to for $235! I make sane rationale reservations with ""standard"" layovers and airline changes (or cancels) a flight doesn't inform me and after I learn about it and try to make sense of the booking again they are happy to change for additional $$$.

For a two-hour flight something more substantial should be available in First. And nothing else even available for purchase. Staff on board ok. Disappointing apart from the seat comfort and space.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Jared Costley,United States,9/22/2014,I have had several horrible experiences with Delta. One time on my way back from a vacation from Hawaii Delta changed the connecting flight from the Las Vegas Airport to an earlier time. I was not informed until I arrived in Las Vegas only to find out that our connecting flight had already departed. The Delta Customer Service clerk was extremely unhelpful and ended up booking us on a flight that left 5 hours later. I sat in the Las Vegas airport with two small children for several hours. Today I was supposed to fly out to New York at 11.00 am for an important business trip. As I was leaving for the airport I got a call from Delta stating that the flight was delayed until 12.15 pm. Since that phone call the flight has been further delayed three-times. Delta is the worst airline I have ever flown on hands-down with extremely poor customer service.,,,Economy,,1,3,1,3,2,,,1,0

My seat did not recline and my flight was LA to Sydney it means 15 hours flying in the same position. The seat was near the back of the plane where the flight attendants stay during the flight. They wouldn't close the curtains so it was always with lights on and I could hear them talking and laughing for 15 hours. It was my worst nightmare and I do not recommend Delta to anyone.

Transatlantic flew an old but recently refurbished 767-2 which was clean and comfortable. Was fortunate to get an exit row seat meaning I had lots of leg room and being 6'3 this was a blessing! Seats were a little hard but no more so than other airlines. Entertainment system was very good lots of options and food and drinks were served regularly. Cabin crew were very friendly and always happy to help. Flight departed on time and arrived early in ATL. ATL-QUI - very old 757-2 and desperately needed refurbing. Seats were worn out no entertainment overhead TVs existed but not used and cabin crew were less friendly. Drinks only served once on a 5 hour flight and food was very poor in comparison to the other flight. Standard American airline for me very good transatlantic but domestic/South America used tired fleet and much less effort made. Will certainly use again if I need to fly transatlantic as was an excellent experience but still much to improve on the other side of the pond.,,,Economy,,7,3,4,4,4,,,4,1

All passengers were greeted by the F/A as they boarded. Flight left a few minutes late but arrived early. The meal consisted of a cold shrimp/chicken platter or a turkey/chicken sandwich which was very good. Service was good. My only complaint is the seating. The seat is more comfortable than Economy Comfort but Delta should add an inch of pitch in the first class cabin. I did not rate the inflight entertainment as there was none available due to the short flight. Delta 2043 first class on 09-11-14 JFK to ATL. Flight left about 30 minutes late due to mechanical problems. The captain gave detailed and many updates concerning takeoff times which was appreciated. The plane was an MD 88.

When I just called to inquire about a seat assignment the representative was beyond rude and said if I could not afford the upgrade then I can wait till I get to the gate like always.

What a waste of money. I chose to purchase rather than upgrade and still lost my seats. The trip down here in first class offered potato chips for lunch and one drink because our flight attendant spent his time talking to another flight attendant that must have been riding for free because she didn't come out of the galley the entire flight.

The crew were very friendly and attentive to our needs. The food was excellent and nicely presented and served by our attentive stewardess. We felt this was the best flight we have taken in a very long time and was reminiscent of air travel from the old days.

The economy comfort seats had adequate legroom but almost no recline making it impossible for me to nap (the seat backs had a tilt-your- head-forward built-in headrest). The seats on Endeavour had minimal legroom but more recline and I was able to nap during the two-hour flight to Toronto. The plastic armrests on the SMF-MSP flight were extremely uncomfortable.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,D Stewart,Canada,8/26/2014,My husband and I have taken a few trips a year with our kids (now 4 and 3) since they were babies and never had such a terrible experience. Getting to our destination was alright - we booked an overnight flight so that the kids would sleep and ended up with 2 extra seats next to us. Staff were all very polite and helpful. However before our return we were informed by e-mail that our 2 flights with a connection of just over an hour had been cancelled and we had been re-booked on 4 flights - yes 3 layovers to get us from one major airport in the US to another in Canada. My husband spent over an hour on the phone getting this changed and it took a great deal of insisting that 4 flights would not work especially with young kids. Our travel dates were flexible as was the departure airport from Florida but this didn't make a difference. We were finally re-booked on 2 flights with an almost 6 hour layover. We were told that having a layover longer than 5 hours would result in additional fees which we of course refused to pay and Delta reluctantly agreed. On the day of the flight we arrived at our gate to find out that our first flight had been delayed almost an hour and our second flight had been delayed 3 hours. (which now resulted in an 8 hour layover!). The airport staff was extremely accommodating and offered to re book us on a flight early the next morning with a 2 hour layover and cover our hotel expenses for the night. We appreciated the offer but decided to decline because we were already at our departure gate and didn't want to repeat the check in and security process the following day. Sometime during our 8 hour layover we looked at our boarding passes and noticed that none of us were sitting together on our second flight. After putting up with an excessive amount of delays and attitude from Delta over the phone and by e-mail I would have gladly left my then 2 and 4 year olds alone for Delta staff to entertain during the flight but after some insisting on my part we were all seated together.,,,Economy,,3,3,3,4,2,,,3,0

My flight to the US was nothing better than the usual - in fact simply average no comment to make. However the adventure begins on my returning flight from Chicago on 30th December. Upon checking in my luggage in Chicago I find out that my flight to Atlanta had been cancelled - apparently for weather reasons. I quickly had customer service representatives put me on an alternative route: Chicago - New York - Prague - Munich. However upon embarking the flight to New York we had technical difficulties and could not take off on time. When we did I had already missed my connection. Knowing about this situation I asked the flight attendant to assist just to be told ""hold on we'll look into it"" or ""you simply ask the ground staff in New York they'll sort you out"". Upon arriving in JFK instead of making my way to the gate I straight went to Delta Customer Services. Getting there it was like being at a fish market - people arguing kids crying and the Delta Customer Service staff simply could not be bothered. When it was my turn I was not greeted I was not asked how I was doing and nor was given the generic apology for delays experienced. After a long discussion I was put on a flight from New York - Frankfurt - Munich. After a couple of hours of transit with no amenities or vouchers provided I got on the flight for Frankfurt - I was put right at the back despite various empty seats. I reached Frankfurt to find out - my ticket was never issued for Munich! However being German speaking and after being handed to competent Fraport staff and discussing the issue with them in detail - the situation was dealt with in an excellent manner and I was on my next flight to Munich.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,C Lyttle,United States,8/18/2014,A few months ago I was flying home from Chicago via Minneapolis. I don't really care to connect but Delta had the lowest fares and I was okay with that. The flight to Minneapolis from Chicago was delayed due to a plane issue. The staff on the ground were excellent at handling the issue and on the plane they were helpful as well. Unfortunately this was not the case with the rest of the staff. Upon arrival to Minneapolis I had to run to my gate to make my flight. As I got there I had to argue with the gate attendant about getting my seat. Note I'm a 17 year old who can't book a hotel has nowhere to stay and needs to be on that flight the last one out that night. Thankfully the man gave me his seat and I made it home. Staff on the MSP-MCO leg were very rude. I was very unimpressed. I love Delta but it put a sour taste in my mouth.,,,Economy,,6,4,2,4,4,,,4,1
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,J Peng,United States,8/18/2014,We are a family of 6 going on vacation from San Jose California to Las Vegas with a connecting flight in Los Angeles. We missed our flight from San Jose to LA and therefore missed our connecting flight from LA to Vegas and therefore wasted a whole day (1/3 of our trip) in LAX. We missed our flight in San Jose because we did not arrive at the gate until the last 3 min of departing time. However two of our family members arrived at the gate early because they used the handicapped express lane at security point. The family members that arrived early told the gate agent that there are more people coming please wait. The agent was rude did not even page for our names and refuse to wait. By the time the rest of the family got to the gate the plane has already taken off 2min earlier which is 5 min earlier than departing time!

The aircraft is an old 747 but renovated a few years back with the lie flat seats and if you're in the upper deck very nice indeed. It's quiet two toilets for less than 20 passengers and two flight attendants. The entertainment selection is excellent. My vegetarian meal was OK nothing special but not bad. It was a smooth and comfortable flight. The only complaint I have is about the service. The FA's on US carriers are very familiar and have a jokey attitude that I think most Americans quite enjoy. I have lived overseas for over 20 years and do not like that. I prefer kind polite service without the constant sarcasm and humor.,,,Business Class,,8,4,3,4,5,,,4,1

About 2.5 hours before flight received automated call that flight from Lansing had been cancelled and that they would call back with a rebooking (no explanation given as to why the flight was cancelled). Automated call back had put me on a flight out the next day at around 1.30 in the afternoon getting me to Dallas about 5.30pm on 12th. I called back and managed to get rebooked on a flight on the 12th leaving Lansing to Detriot at 6am then on to DFW getting in around 9.20am the next day (an effort to try to salvage most of the work day on the 12th). Arrived to Lansing airport about 4.30am on the 12th only to be told that the 6am flight was also cancelled (again gate agent had no explanation of why the flight was cancelled). Their only option was to put me on the same afternoon flight the automated service had booked me on the previous day. My 80-something year old parents ended up driving me to Detroit to make the 7.28am connection. Complained to Delta and was given a refund of about $29 (which I haven't seen yet).

The IFE was good with a good selection. The internal flight down to MCO was delayed an hour due to bad weather but we made up some time during the flight.

Put us on a flight to Atlanta Airport transferred to another flight to JFK. After boarding waited for about an hour to find out they could not take off due to weather. We were then put on standby at another Atlanta terminal. We had advised the counter person that we had a doctor's appointment in NY the next morning and needed to get there. In watching the monitor for open seats I noticed they were asking for people that wanted to upgrade to 1st class. We had paid for 1st class round-trip tickets and were not called to fill in those seats. Because I complained about the service we were able to take those seats. We arrived At JFK at about 1.30 am the next day. Because of Delta we paid for a $200 hotel room that we did not use. When leaving JFK on our return trip on Delta we sat on the plane for 1.5 hours for a cap from a baggage handler to be removed from engine that had been sucked into it we finally took off. We should have been treated more courteously and not like a herd of cattle especially as a 1st class ticket holder. We paid for more!,,,First Class,,1,3,2,2,1,,,1,0

I arrived at Minneapolis 40 minutes between flights so plenty of time then we were told that there will be a delay because of mechanical issues and had to wait for a new plane. While we were waiting at the next gate we found out that plane was also delayed for mechanical issues. The replacement plane finally arrived 2 hours later we boarded and were just about to back out of the gate when the captain announced that we will be delayed for mechanical issues. I arrived 2.5 hours later from my scheduled arrival time. The return trip wasn't any better the plane arrived 2 hours late. I arrived in Atlanta as my connecting flight was taking off. That was the last flight out of Atlanta until the next morning. I got my ticket no problem but when I asked about a hotel. They would only give me a coupon for a reduced rate.

This was my second flight on Delta and I was unfamiliar with their seating protocol. On August 8 Flight 5151 from LGA to CLT I asked a flight attendant if the flight was full and if I could move my seat. She did not refuse. Another flight attendant arrived and the two attendants had a less than professional conversation. She then walked up to me with a flight manage at and asked if I was passenger (name) and then said I could not sit in this seat because these seats were Premium. It was a false show.

My wife had asked for boarding assistance due to an arm injury and she said whenever she made any move on the GRU-ATL leg an attendant was at her side almost immediately. No Delta club at GRU so had to use the somewhat smaller and more basic Gol Airlines club. First class for the ATL-MDW and SEA-DTW legs was your basic domestic first class.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,R Kelly,Australia,7/29/2014,"One thing I find really ironic with Delta Airlines is at the beginning of the safety video they state that ""your comfort and needs are our first priority"" when it's is absolutely not the case it seems like it's the profit Delta can make. I'm not normally one to complain however after flying with Delta 3 times something needed to be said. From LA to NY return and from NY to Honolulu my family were unable to have seating together due to not booking a 'particular way' despite the fact we booked months in advance! It seems this manner of booking was only available to people who booked in USA as no information on booking allocated seats was known to us (Australian origin). Moreover we weren't the only people who encountered this issue. Another passenger was unable to be seated with their 4 and 8 year old children due to their ridiculous seating policy. Do it the right way Delta first checked in first choice. Service was bad. Rude at check in. Rude and unhelpful at the gate and even on flight they held their tradition by attendants having domestic quarrels on the plane around passengers. Food is terrible all flights are over 5 hours and only offered 2 biscuits or a small bag of pretzels unless you pay. Some entertainment also unavailable; however what was available were decent movies. Surprisingly Delta can do something right. Save your time money and hunger for an airline who cares about their passengers needs.

Inflight service was dire and not at mainline airline standard - inflight entertainment consists of the safety briefing and looking out the window.

The upgrade of the business cabin to business elite with lie flat beds was a great way to fully relax and get quality sleep.

My current trip to Alaska from PHL leaves me without either of my bags because the Delta connecting flight out of MSP was 45 minutes delayed. Why was it delayed? Because they needed to kick 8 people off due to weight. This makes me wonder if they knew where they were flying before we got on. How can this oversight occur?

The experience quickly went from bad to abysmal after being delayed in Chicago. The flight crew could not help anyone with connections in Minneapolis. Although it was still afternoon the 800 number people were unable to come up with any alternate route. After nearly 4 hours of delay which included all the passengers deplaning we were loaded onto the plane after the gate next to us with a later flight going Minneapolis loaded. My flight to Phoenix which had also been delayed due to weather left 30 minutes before I got there and had our flight gone first as it should have I probably would have made my connection. But the Delta personal were unable or unwilling to deal with passenger issues like this. Instead I bunked down in the Minneapolis airport overnight. Meals were not provided even though all the restaurants in the airport were closed or closing when we arrived. The next day after 27.5 hours of travel I arrived in Phoenix but one of my bags did not.

We had no gate to return to at JFK so we went to the maintenance lot and were bussed back to the terminal. Had to wait for a new plane (another hour). Re-boarding pandemonium. Most frustrating was waiting another hour on the tarmac before taxi-ing await from gate for catering. this was around 11.30am. We got nothing to eat drink except one bottle of water. Arrived MSP around 12.30am. Pretty awful. Stewardesses standing around on their cell phone. Skip Delta if you have the chance.,,,Economy,,2,1,2,2,0,,,2,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,George Bosse,United States,6/25/2014,Flights in purchased domestic first class with changeover in Minneapolis. Lots of weather delays and was kept well informed and phone conversations with customer service were pleasant. The first three legs of the journey were nothing special. Notably the quality of the product purchased was only that of a larger seat. Inflight service was casual at best and I would not call it friendly. We were tolerated and it kind of felt like we were an inconvenience. The last flight however had a flight attendant who was service oriented and actually took care of the customer properly and a meal was served. To me this tells me that there is a quality issue at Delta. The inflight service product is not consistent.,,,First Class,,4,4,2,2,1,,,3,1

My pregnant wife and I sat for over an hour (on the curb) for them to correct the error. We flew to our next location to find the same issue with boarding. We sat outside the line for a half hour while they tried to correct before the plane flew off. I spoke to Delta and they said because of the economy they are having issues. This does not explain why they couldn't send us an e-mail showing our flights changed with new boarding passes. The worst flying experience ever.

I really must say that all the flights were great. Every flight was on-time the flight crews were exceptionally good the in-flight entertainment was good but could be improved the meals were good and tasty. I only wish Delta would update its meal service and add some new items. Going over to MUC the man behind me even commented to the flight attendant ""Is it the usual?"" It is always steak chicken breast pasta (no meat or fish - just pasta) and a cold plate. I've written to DL about adding fish lamb duck etc. to the rotation. (They actually had lamb on the MUC-ATL flight!) Even flight attendants say that every time they have ""fish"" it is the most ordered by passengers. I guess Michelle Bernstein has run out of ideas.

The check in process was difficult since we are foreigners trying to leave the country. Nothing against Delta. The delta gate agents went through 3 security procedures before we even lined up to go to the plane. I think it was the airport's rules. I flew a Delta 757-200 to Atlanta on a red-eye flight. We took off around 11.40 pm and we started flying over the Pacific Ocean. There was no personal entertainment on this type of aircraft so we were forced to watch a movie. They started serving ""breakfast"" around 1.20 am. ""Breakfast"" was a cold turkey and mayonnaise sandwich fruit and a brownie. They took they tray away and we did not eat anything else. Around 5.00 am we started our descent into Atlanta. The landing was smooth and we soon de-boarded and headed through immigration to board our next 56 min flight to Birmingham. Atlanta airport is very confusing as to where restaurants and lounges are. We boarded our MD88 to Birmingham. Since it was an hour flight they should have served us something but the didn't.

Delayed our taxi to airport by 2 hours. Got to airport to find flight now cancelled but no email communication from Delta no phone call just the pleasure of an extra 1.5 hours at the airport as they had rebooked us onto 3.20 flight. Staff no training in apologising to passengers for inconvenience - staff couldn't give a damn. Although travelling with my husband they couldn't be bothered to sit us together. So was the flight cancelled for bad weather? I don't think so. Too many additional reasons given eg staff not able to fly as on duty too long etc. We then discovered that the earlier flight had been cancelled too. Could this have been about consolidation.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,J Gardner,United States,6/12/2014,We flew paid business class fares in Delta's Business Elite LAX to SYD and SYD to LAX in the forward B/E cabin on Delta's 777-200LR. We checked in using the kiosks in Delta's terminal and went through security quickly (we are both Global Entry/Precheck). The Delta SkyClub at LAX which doubles as Delta's business class lounge was crowded noisy and inferior in all respects to the business class lounges operated by other carriers to Australia we've flown on (ANZ and QF). For what it's worth Delta uses the ANZ business class lounge in Sydney and in all respects it's superior to Delta's SkyClub. The flight was delayed. Despite Delta's explanations the real reason for the constant late departures is that Sydney's airport operates under a curfew. It's the same problem coming back to LAX as ICE/Customs don't start clearing baggage/passengers until 8am - resulting in people sitting on the plane for a fair amount of time following arrival. Once in the air the flight itself was OK. The Delta flatbed seat on the 777-200 is adequate but inferior to the seats on ANZ's 777 and the QF A380 - both of those airlines provide business class passengers with a mattress that is laid over the top of the seat when reclined. The meal service both directions was in all respects inferior to business class meal services on ANZ QF and CX. The portions are tiny and the food itself is mediocre. The cabin crew LAX to SYD was OK but the crew returning SYD- LAX was disorganized distracted and not terribly personable. Delta's AVOD system on its 777 aircraft is antiquated. The pop-out monitors will not stay upright - many passengers around us had this problem. The moving map and flight information displays need to be updated. The headphones provided by Delta are supposed to be noise cancelling but don't work well (we both use Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones so it really didn't matter). Given the cost of business class tickets and all things being equal the only thing Delta has going for it on its 777 service to/from SYD is the privacy and relative quiet of its herringbone seating arrangement. Otherwise based on any other criteria you choose to use Delta's product is inferior compared to the other carriers we have flown on to/from Australia and New Zealand (ANZ QF and CX). We can't recommend Delta for business class to/from Sydney.,,,Business Class,,4,3,2,1,2,,,2,0

The seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in Economy - with a great selection of films TV shows and music. The food whilst being obviously ""airline food"" was nice enough and lots of it. They listed only one meal - lunch - on the website but they served two more rounds of snacks throughout the flight - an ok sandwich and a really nice calzone. The staff were really friendly as well. Again I was dreading the service as a lot of other reviews mentioned their bad attitude. But the ones on my flight were lovely.

Constantly coming through the cabin with refreshments certainly not dehydrated at the end of the flight. Only criticism was when we were coming in to land into London the cabin crew did not ask passengers to raise their closed window blinds which made me feel a little unsafe sitting in the middle seats as I couldn't see what was going on outside during landing. The flight attendant told me after it's not US policy to raise the window blinds Delta why not just make it part of your safety policy. Would fly them again.,,,Economy,,10,5,5,5,4,,,5,1

We flew from San Antonio to Atlanta to catch a connecting flight to Milan for a long awaited vacation. As we were boarding the 767 in Atlanta I noticed the port engine nacelle was open. Once we were buckled in the captain announced that maintenance was waiting on a part and it would take up to an hour to depart. An hour goes by and they have the part but they can't get it installed.

On same day Delta re-booked flight to Atlanta departing from another airport and for a later time. To get to this airport cost us $175.00. However once at the airport we begged to Delta to get us on a flight to Lima Peru instead Delta personnel there and over the phone made a mockery of our request by pretending to help us when in reality they were just wasting our time.

The Cabin was not clean and very narrow bathrooms have some odor and seats were comfortable even for a seven hour flight. Everything else went ok the crew looked exhausted and smiled less they were friendly and very caring. Also to mention food portions are quite small and selections must be thought carefully. If it was not for their 767-300 plane everything went very well.

I try to plan and budget for everything and was very irritated when I checked two bags for $25 each - Delta Advertises on the back of your ticket ""Your first checked bag is always free"" (within their recommended size and under 50lbs checked their website prior to our trip to avoid charges). I don't care if you charge me for my luggage but seriously don't advertise one thing and say another. If you book your tickets 6 months in advance and you pick your seats on that airplane and the plane is empty when you pick them you should at least be able to sit next to your significant other - but don't bother its a waste of time.

Our first experience with Delta involved our honeymoon - they overbooked our flight to go to Jackson Hole so they re routed us to a different airport and set us up with a car service to take us to Jackson Hole (this delayed our trip about 5-6 hours and we were driving through Yellowstone Park in pitch black to our cabin). They also gave us Delta vouchers to put towards a ticket for our next flight. So we bought tickets to visit family overseas later with our vouchers and it was the biggest mistake of our lives. Our connecting flight was delayed because of weather- but they just kept pushing the time every 10 minutes making you think you would be able to really make it to our connecting international flight at JFK. We got on the plane 5 hours late and made it to the gate at JFK for our flight about 10 minutes before it was scheduled to depart. Well they didn't let us board the plane because they closed the door already (ok fine they said it was a security issue) so we watched our plane take off without us and mind you its already midnight at this point. So we are directed by the staff to go to the Delta counter so we did that. There was one woman at the desk that was eager to leave and she said that the next flight was overbooked by 16 people (no surprise we noticed that Delta tends to overbook their flights and basically makes people take one of their stupid vouchers just to re-experience Delta again) and that she could put us on a flight with one connection - but we would basically be getting to our destination 3 days later than we were originally supposed to. We are on vacation time off work and are going overseas to a country that is far away to see close family so every minute counts - she handed us what looked to be tickets but later we found out were just itineraries. So we could not go back through TSA to the ""nicer"" part of the terminal where there were comfortable chairs and food because we didn't have official tickets. Panic set in and were stranded at the airport with only 2 stalls available to go to the bathroom and no where to comfortably sit. My mom was able to get tickets for us on the flight that was supposedly overbooked and she was also told that we would get reimbursed for a hotel room should we choose to get one. There were no Delta agents at airport that could help us with anything. We contacted Delta to try to get reimbursed and we were sent in circles no manager available to help etc kept telling us to visit the Delta site and use the number there - even though we already did that they accused us of basically making up the fact that someone told us we would get reimbursed? So after 2 hours of getting no where we were fed up. Many other people I know have had bad experiences with Delta  they warned us before we booked with them.

Once on board the experience lessens as the attendants seemingly are frequently tired and occasionally indifferent. I have never been hot (not warm but hot as in a cabin temp of the high 70's) on an overseas flight. A request to a attendant brought the equivalent of a sleepy shrug. The food is edible and the presentation tries to be quality but it falls flat with the quality of the food and the occasional rush to serve and clear. I hate the business class pods - ok for the sleeper or someone doing work but impossible to talk or interact at all with a companion. Baggage handling is excellent for sky priority.

Delta has the best inflight entertainment system I have used with a massive selection of entertainment. Having said that they really need to do something about their meals as they were awful and almost as bad as Air Canada. I didn't eat my main course as it smelt awful food but was supposed to be beef stroganoff.

Seats were comfortable. Service in the airport-Good service no long lines and friendly airport crew! I enjoyed Delta and will fly them again!,,,Economy,,10,4,5,5,5,,,5,1
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,B Wijesinghe,United States,5/5/2014,"DCA-ATL-DCA MD-90; Economy. ""We love to fly and it shows"" used to be Delta's slogan. Standards have slipped a lot since then. DCA counter bag drop-off was prompt after online check-in and the outbound flight was on time. It is amazing how many seats they have crammed into this aircraft recently to make money from Economy Comfort seats. The seat itself is reasonably comfortable for about two hours but the reduced legroom is awful. I am average height so I feel for taller people. Both planes were very clean and appeared well-maintained for 18+ year-old aircraft. A drink and mini pretzles were served on both flights. ATL bag drop-off after online check-in was quite quick. The inbound flight was delayed by 75 minutes but they made-up 25 minutes of that lost time. Flight attendants outbound were friendlier than those inbound. Overall this type of service will be acceptable for two to three hour flight segments and I will use Delta again.",,,Economy,,6,3,4,3,0,,,3,1
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,S Roessler,United States,5/4/2014,We flew from Atlanta to Portland the check in process was chaotic and disorganized. We had checked in online but had not printed our boarding passes. One representative told us to leave the line and finalize the check in at the kiosk. We got out of line to do this and the kiosk was out of paper we got back in line and the same rep told us to go back to the kiosk - we refused. There was only one kiosk working at this time! The rep at the counter was much better informed and completed our check in within a couple of minutes. This kind of disorganization caused at least one customer I talked with to miss her flight! In addition there is so little leg room that it is ridiculous and so uncomfortable. I did not feel like the staff were very friendly or helpful. On a positive note our plane landed on time and our luggage was there too.,,,Economy,,5,1,3,2,0,,,3,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,K Williams,United Kingdom,5/4/2014,Flew MAN-ATL-HNL and LIH-LAX-ATL-MAN in Business Elite/First. Outbound flatbeds on both legs although I found the 'herringbone' 330 better than the 'offset' 767. Food and drink good on both but I noticed that Delta have stopped their wonderful hot nuts on Business Elite (MAN-ATL) but they were still served on First (ATL-HNL). Return LIH-LAX was delayed 3.5 hours due to computer failure at LAX. Delta contacted us (unlike United) so we were able to delay our arrival at Kauai Airport (LIH). The 757 on this route was very tatty with a number of broken footrests and ought to be retired. We made the connection at LAX and ATL and arrived at MAN 30 minutes early. Refreshments on the two First segments were acceptable and excellent on Business Elite. The staff on all flights were very attentive.,,,Business Class,,8,4,5,5,4,,,5,1
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,J Katnic,United States,5/4/2014,Flight 387 from GUA to LAX on 4/26/2014. Delta procedures at GUA appalling! Each time I fly back on this route things get worse. It appears that you can no longer check in at a counter. After taking our 6 bags to the check in counter we were told to go back to kiosks to do our check in while the Delta employees sat around. If this was a domestic flight I would say there would be no issue. The fact that you have to attempt scanning of passports makes things a bit more difficult especially if you're not used to it. This process took an additional 20 minutes for the 4 of us. As the check in area isn't air conditioned the extra wait time left us sweaty and fed-up by the time we made it to the gate. Plane was late coming in. While waiting in the boarding line we looked to find that 3 of 4 seats had been changed. We went back to the ticket desk at the gate and fortunately were able to get our old seats back. By the time we got onto the plane and took our seats it was apparent that Delta lets babies travel in the first class cabin. The next 6 hours on the plane were frequently interrupted by a two year old that couldn't be controlled by her mother. The flight attendants tried to pacify the child but stopped short of requesting the mother take her child back to economy with the rest of her family. The screaming child aside cabin crew service was great. My four year old was again able to visit the cockpit but found little to do afterwards a this 757-200 only had communal IFE. Either watch the screen in front of the plane or watch nothing else: none of the music stations worked either. Food so-so but drink/snack runs frequent. If a drink/snack was requested in-between nothing was too much trouble. The final act of the Delta ground crew was to bus us to the Bradley Terminal after landing. It took 2 hours from the time the plane landed until we got our bags and I was surprised they were still on the carousel once clearing customs. After all most other international flights come through this terminal. The morning flight always has customs clearance at Terminal 5. If flying Delta was all one had to do it might not be such a bad experience as the flight crews are great. It's the pre post and sometime in-flight policies that Delta management have dreamt up that will make me never fly Delta on this route again. We paid for these tickets as opposed to upgrading so to say we were let down is an understatement. Next time it will be Taca/Avianca.,,,Business Class,,,3,4,3,1,,,3,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,A Bastien,United States,5/4/2014,May 1 2014 Washington DC (DCA) to Minneapolis St. Paul (MSP). I bought an economy class ticket but Delta gave me an economy plus seat. Economy plus had a little more legroom and padding than economy but the seat recline was almost the same as in economy - I couldn't tell the difference. Based on this experience I would not pay extra for economy plus. Delta charged $2.00 for headsets with which to listen to a movie displayed on overhead screens situated every 4-6 rows. I didn't buy the headsets or food so I can't comment on catering or entertainment. Boarding has turned into an unpleasant experience passengers crowding the gate so they can board first and secure overhead bin space. My flight experience deteriorates each time I fly Delta. My spouse is a Platinum frequent flyer which is the only reason I patronize this airline -- no cost award tickets. I can't wait to fly Southwest or Jet Blue (domestic) or Air France KLM Lufthansa international. It seems as though the smiling CEO on the inflight video has nothing but contempt for his economy class passengers.,,,Premium Economy,,2,2,4,1,1,,,1,0

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,A Bastien,United States,5/3/2014,April 27th overnight flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Washington Reagan (DCA) with stopover in Detroit (DTW). Economy seats on flight from SFO to DTW were extremely uncomfortable: hardly any legroom - very little padding no padding on armrests and minimal recline. These are the worst airline seats I've experienced. Delta offered a thin blanket but no pillow. I was unable to sleep. The economy seats from DTW to DCA had slightly more recline and were therefore tolerable. Delta didn't offer food for purchase on these flights and I didn't pay the $2.00 for a headset on the SFO to DTW flight so I am unable to rate food or entertainment (I gave Delta one star for each).,,,Economy,,1,1,4,1,1,,,1,0

If you want to watch a movie you have to pay $6.00. It costs $30.00 to check each bag.

First class seat on the B777 was a comfortable seat if somewhat difficult to settle into at first. The A319 was uncomfortable and took a while to find that special spot to get comfortable. All considered the service I got for what I paid was excellent. Bags were first off the carousel and waiting when I got there which I liked a lot. Only issue was the miserable check in lady in LAX.

Delta Airlines has a poor fleet of plains. They were under staffed and had 2 mechanical breakdowns and were unable to find us other flights. We needed to be home for surgery the next day and paid extra to fly out on Easter. Because we booked with Expedia they said that they Delta was not to blame (they blamed United).

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,C McCarthy,Ireland,4/27/2014,Travelled Dublin to Salt Lake return trip. I normally travel BA which is good but in comparison Delta is a horrible travel experience. The flight attendants are fine but the aircraft used on all four segments were very old and there was a 'domestic' feel to flight that you just don't get with BA which in comparison has newer and cleaner and more spacious aircraft. Perhaps the biggest issue was that Delta typically fly 757 aircraft compared to BA's use of 747 or A380. It just felt far too cramped for long haul. The biggest insult was having paid > $2000 for a return flight to being given a 'beaker' of 100% plonk despite having asked for 'red wine'. I really wanted a glass of wine but if there was a plant nearby I would have dumped it there it was absolutely foul - I'm not a wine snob and would drink anything reasonable but this drink poured from a large container was sickening. I'd fly Delta again but only as a last resort. Having said that the flights were all on time or early maybe lucky but I'd hate to be delayed if the only wine they had onboard in 'coach' was what they gave me on those flights. One more thing although they had VOD the content on offer was very limited with only a handful of movies on offer (in contrast BA usually offer > 30 movies with similar ratios for TV and Music).,,,Economy,,5,2,3,1,2,,,1,0

There was a decent snowstorm going on at the time and I presumed that was the cause of the delay. Arrived late in Atlanta and just missed the connecting flight to Gainesville. Delta staff at Atlanta said the delay was actually due to mechanical reasons and promptly provided meal and hotel vouchers for an excellent hotel and rebooking on the first flight the following morning. Obviously the delayed flight is a negative but in this particular case Delta efficiently made adequate accommodations for stranded passengers in a situation where it would have been easy for them to blame the weather and refuse to make accommodations at all. For that they deserve some commendation.,,,Economy,,7,4,5,4,3,,,4,1

(I fly about 10 times a year and have done so for last 6 years) I don't remember their flight being ever on time. They've failed 100 out of 100 times.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,A Galiano,United States,4/14/2014,I have flown Delta for 20 years and the last few have become completely horrible. The company does not appear to care about the customer any longer. The seats have shrunk to petite size on most flights and I am fairly thin. My knees are in the back of the seat in front of me when I am in coach. The flights are consistently late on departure and arrival. The flights are typically oversold which creates a capacity issue for their service. As a frequent flyer and a business person I can understand the need to increase operating margins but at what cost? I think the executive team should eat their own dog food and ride non-private flights. I am considering abandoning my gold status at Delta for an airline that can do more than lip service.,,,Economy,,,1,4,1,1,,,1,0
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,E Dunn,United States,4/14/2014,Booked on Delta flight out of a local regional airport MLI to New Bern North Carolina via connection in Atlanta. Flight was scheduled to depart at 4.59pm. It was pushed back to 7.30 as the incoming flight out of Atlanta has mechanical problems and they were bringing in another plane. Flight delayed a second time to 8.39pm and cancelled. Both at the delay and cancellation the customers had to leave the secure area and go back out to the ticket counter. We were told the flight was cancelled because the crew timed out. All flights on Delta out of Chicago and United were booked. They have no reciprocating agreement with Southwest or U.S. Air and could not see their reservation. Delta told us to come back the next day at 4.50 for that flight. We finally via the internet were able to book a flight earlier the next day out of Chicago with U.S. Air for $400 more than the original ticket. We had purchased insurance through Alliance. Delta would only refund the ticket price and would not pay the difference. The people at the ticket counter were less than helpful they had given up and didn't care.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,E Sauerwein,United States,4/8/2014,I fly international in economy class from Seattle (SEA) to Japan (NRT) about twice every month. I have flown this route more than 10 times already and with a variety of different airlines. At first I was sceptical about flying with Delta but Delta has made up a lot of ground recently in my opinion. While Delta is no match for Singapore airline's service and no match for ANA's food it does beat out United airlines in both of these categories. One major problem I have with Delta's international flight is that they really only served one meal whereas Singapore and ANA gave you a full 2 meals. Over a 9-10 hour flight having only one major meal feels a little lacking and will leave you hungry walking off the plane. The food that is served is also not exciting but gets the job done. In-flight entertainment is good with plenty of choices and nice screen size/brightness. I fly often so this is particularity important especially over such a long segment. Seat comfort is mediocre but its economy so you get what you pay for however I have used Premium Economy seating with Delta and I'd have to say its worth the few extra $. If flying ANA on this segment on a 787 Dreamliner your Regular Economy seating will outclass Deltas Premium Economy seats however. To rap up I'd say since Delta is usually 100$ cheaper than the other competitors mentioned above you really get what you pay for.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,3,4,,,4,1

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Kaval Lodhie,United States,3/26/2014,"I flew LA to NYC on a red-eye flight this past Sunday March 23rd. The boarding process was an absolute nightmare and that was in part due to some horrible service (more to come). More than 15 people had to check in their bags and all passengers in Economy that could keep their luggage on board were having to put their belongings aisles down in the bins creating a huge mess upon landing. While entering the plane and attempting to put our things away we were ""greeted"" by an extremely sarcastic condescending and ""rudely-friendly"" air hostess who would individually call out any person taking longer than 15 seconds to put away their things. After embarrassing quite a few passengers including myself who were tired and exhausted and about to take a 6 hour red-eye she proceeded to call one passenger ""cute very handsome"" and helped him out by putting his luggage in first class. A few minutes later after everyone else was told to check in their bags a mother came in with a son with special needs stated she had to keep her luggage on board because his medicines and change of clothes were all in there and the hostess proceeded to tell her there's nothing she can do except give her a bag for her medicines. After take-off (which was 25 minutes late) the passengers proceeded to sleep (as one does past midnight) and the air hostesses (namely the sarcastic one) proceeded to talk at full volume inconsiderate of the passengers. As a side note the other hostesses were quite nice. After 6 hours on a rather uncomfortable seat we started our decent with yet again the sarcastic hostess picking out her two favorite passengers and offering them secret mimosas while the rest of us looked on.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,T Matava,United States,3/17/2014,DL1467 13 Mar ATL-SAN. Flight operated with 767 equipment. As with all DL west coast flights medallion upgrades limited to a very few high Diamonds (I am a platinum medallion and was about 17 on the list for 5 upgrade seats). However the Economy Comfort seat was quite comfortable but more importantly the inflight service was superb. Flight time was 4hrs 15mins and the somewhat senior cabin crew provided non-stop service. Two drink runs water in between and a flight attendant always in the aisle. Special requests fulfilled graciously. This was true Delta service from the heart and was to me a benchmark of what DL can be. Even though I am a Million Miler I was impressed by one of the best flights I have had.,,,Economy,,10,5,5,4,5,,,5,1
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,T Lammers,United States,3/17/2014,Flew DL007 from DXB to ATL. I have traveled this flight 12 or more times. Most of the time my experience is always positive. This specific trip the IFE was not working very well for the first 3+ hours of the flight. They had to reset the system about 4 or 5 times. I was seated in 44J (Exit row window seat). I always sit in Row 44 which is the row with nothing in front of you. I am a frequent flyer so I have this option. The food was decent. The mid flight snack is normally just a turkey sandwich and a mini banana. You can normally get one drink with your meal just ask for it. The flight attendants are very kind every time on this flight. Sometimes you get a joker too. The bathrooms always become quite disgusting but that's understandable on a 15 hour flight. I enjoyed my flight but will be flying Business class with my miles next flight.,,,Economy,,8,5,5,4,3,,,5,1

This obviously wasn't the airlines fault so you cannot give them a worse score for the weather. We were complimentary upgraded to business class on this flight but since the plane had landed the night prior they didn't have the hot meal we received on the way down. They did however give us all the cookies and chips and any other snacks they had. Along with liquor. The seats were very comfortable and the flight attendants were very courteous.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,C Shulman,United States,3/14/2014,Rochester to Ft Lauderdale through Atlanta 3/6/14 - 3/9/14. I was very happy with two aspects and unhappy with one. We taxied from the gate in Atlanta found there were tornadoes in Florida and turned back to the gate. The speed with which we were told what happened and with which Delta decided to bring us back to the gate were beyond anything I've recently experienced from the airlines. I was very impressed with the kindness and quick solution when I got home after the trip realized I left a book on the plane called the airport held it for me and I got it back two days later. My one complaint was with the one hour line to get through TSA at 5 am March 9 in Ft Lauderdale-I think Delta blames this on TSA. Overall very satisfied with Delta.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,3,0,,,4,1
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Anthony Austin Jr,United States,3/12/2014,PHL-CDG-PHL on a Boeing 757ER. Went on a family vacation to Paris back in July 2013. Leaving Philly the flight left on time at 9pm and got to Paris 30 minutes early around 10.15am. Flight wasn't full so I went to an empty row to lay down for the almost 8hr flight. Each seat had TV's in the headrest and the plane had wifi but flying over the Atlantic ocean the wifi didn't. The food served wasn't the best and the complimentary breakfast was a joke they gave us OJ a banana and a blueberry muffin. Leaving Paris we had an hour delay because of a storm and when we finally boarded the plane we had another half hour delay because a family of 10 had a virus and were all forced to get off. My original seat flying from Paris was changed without any notification prior to the vacation. Luckily my mother checked the flights each day to make sure nothing bad happened to our flights. The flight was full minus the family who got kicked off the plane. For the almost 8hr flight you would think they would use a 2 aisle plane instead of one. My TV didn't work. For long haul flights I doubt I'll take Delta again.,,,Economy,,5,3,4,3,2,,,3,0

Thankful this flight wasn't any longer then it was. Experience was awful and I felt very unwelcome as if I was an inconvenience. Flight crew were young and seemed new to the airline industry. I assumed they'd be into their job and enthusiastic I experienced the complete opposite. No hello or goodbye while entering and deplaning the aircraft by any crew member. Ticket scanner while boarding was not working so the rude gate agent was checking the tickets by hand. Crew rushed through the safety announcement and we were in the air within 5 minutes. Ok legroom however the armrests where painful to rest your arm on. Restrooms in rear were out of order leaving everyone on the plane to have to all use the one restroom in first class.

We received excellent service from everyone. The attendants encouraged our tall teenage boys to move to seats with more legroom as the flight was not full and supplied them with all the refreshments they asked for with a smile. They gave us great advise for when we landed. Extra cups of tea were not a problem and also came with delicious cookies! Our return flight a week later was even better with the same crew who were interested in our trip and how we had got on with the snowstorms.

The first plane which left on time backed into a baggage cart. They couldn't find a crew for the replacement. Ended up spending the night in Detroit (at my expense) the 1st and 2nd aircraft the next morning both had mechanical issues. Customer Service in Detroit for the most part is the worst I've ever seen. Rude uninformed incompetent etc. Thanks to a fellow passenger who told me that a flight to Burlington had 14 empty seats I got home on aircraft #5.

This is the first time I have used Delta Airlines. The value for money was great. The meals were some of the best I have tasted inflight with a good selection. The entertainment was also extremely good with a vast selection to choose from. The staff were not warm and friendly and the plane was not cleaned to a great standard there were peanuts down the side of the chair that had been there for some time. The staff did not know who their partnership airlines were and we were advised to go to a different terminal due too this.

The plane itself was new leg space was a lot better than for instance on Air Berlin flights. The safety video was the funniest I had seen. Delta definitely had the greatest selection of films I have seen on the plane although some of them had Russian/Chinese/Korean subtitles but I wasn't disturbed by that. I know a flight is not all about food but I was surprised by the variety of things served. The crew were generally very friendly and served the first round of drinks approximately an hour after take off followed by snacks (pretzels and salted peanuts) a fantastic hot lunch (chicken/rice/vegetables) and tea/coffee straight afterwards. The next round of snacks (same than before) was served a few hours later and 1.5 hours before landing we even got another meal this time a hot tomato-mozarella sandwich followed by ice-cream. I would certainly recommend flying with Delta.,,,Economy,,9,4,4,4,5,,,5,1

The incoming flight from Atlanta arrived more or less on time but as soon as it landed it was clear there was a problem with the aircraft. It turns out that none of the lavatories were functional. This caused a severe delay making me reschedule my entire journey one day later. I was offered a hotel - which was fine - and given what was described to me as meal vouchers. These were not fine. They were in fact practically useless pieces of paper. No one took the time to explain that they were only valued at $6. A fact I was also unaware of until I came to pay and pay I did. As far as I am concerned if I am given a meal voucher I expect a meal. In fact this worthless piece of paper does not buy anything on the menu - even a bowl of soup. To add insult to injury there was no breakfast voucher at all. American airlines already have a bad reputation so perhaps I should not have expected better.,,,Economy,,1,3,4,3,3,,,3,0

It is impossible to get an upgrade as a Platinum Medallion between Florida and California on Delta. In addition the system wide upgrades are never available. Furthermore the planes are smaller always packed. After flying 2.5 million miles with Delta it clearly has gone downhill. Loyalty means nothing. If you fly from Florida to California often and need to try and do some work on the trip avoid Delta. Their upgrade policy is a classic bait and switch.

The food was fantastic and filling. I liked the fact that there was a great selection of entrees both for the main meal and the meal prior to landing. The seat sort of reminded me of L'Espace Affaires on Air France in 2007. That said it was very comfortable. The only downside is that I was unable to sleep. The flight crew going to Dublin was nothing short of fantastic. The flight crew returning was great but not as good as the outgoing crew. The in- flight entertainment was OK. While I didn't explore as much on the outgoing flight I was able to watch 3 movies I had not seen on the return flight. The only real downside is that it cost me nearly double the frequent flier miles to fly for free than it had cost me when I flew Delta to Dublin in 2000.

The flight attendants did several drink runs although they only pour half a can unlike other airlines. Each passenger had their own personal backseat TV and the movie/music/game selection was fantastic. Headphones are provided for those didn't bring their own. Toilets were clean and hot towels are provided to freshen up. The second leg from JFK-PHX was less impressive. Entertainment is provided by an old CRT monitor in the centre of the aisle meaning you have no choice in what you watch. Expect old sitcom reruns. No meals on this flight either despite it being nearly as long as DUB-JFK. The boredom of this flights combined with my hunger meant I couldn't wait to get off.

BKK can have lengthy immigration queues and all major carriers provide this 'fast track' card which is a must when arriving into BKK.

On a flight I took recently from Moscow to NYC during both take off and landing the roof of the plane was leaking a lot of water (over passengers). If you were sitting in a window seat (like me) it seemed to leak quite a lot enough to get you wet. The leaking eventually stopped when the plane was higher up in the air. The flight attendants couldn't really do anything about it since it was an issue with the plane itself. I left bad feedback on the flight and filed a complaint and Delta never seems to respond.

The seat had a good amount of width and AC power outlets were available underneath. PTVs were also available with an excellent selection of holiday and other films.

Food needs more investment - not terrible but not brilliant. In flight entertainment terrific but both our screens skipped and jumped on both legs (we were generously and quickly compensated for this post flight - excellent). Lack of lounge at CUN a bit disappointing on the return. We encountered many Delta staff on the journey - all are a cut above most airlines for the personal human touches. They genuinely engage.

Ok no problem I'll listen the music channels nothing not one channel other than the one tied into the screen. I was told by the flight attendant that they no longer offer it.

Delta may fail to meet expectation of many people who fly within the States but for international flight I find they do pretty well. The flight for both legs was on time and actually arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. I love their B777-200LR. I understand that Delta is an American airline so the seat was designed for a typical Caucasian. Thus the seat appears bigger and gave me more than enough space for the size of a typical Asian without upgrading my ticket. Meals were nice with various choice of beverage. There were a lot of choices for IFE from movies to music. Flight attendants were quite nice and helpful. The only minus point probably is long process of check-in at Changi (my bags were checked 3 times before boarding) which I understand due to fear of terror on flights to the US. Overall it was still a good experience especially the first time with Delta. I would definitely fly with them again for my trip to the USA some time in the future.,,,Economy,,9,5,4,4,5,,,5,1

I did and they told me to call customer service. I did that and they said they cant do anything because I need to talk to a gate agent. They gave me the run around and really did not care. Flying home was more mechanical problems. I wound up having to sleep in DTW airport. No hotels available. When I boarded flight DL6121 the agent was slow. I fly for work and will no longer fly Delta. The ground crew and flight crew were all great and concerned for the safety of the passengers. The gate agents lack any general concern for customers safety comfort or well being.,,,Economy,,,2,4,4,1,,,0,0

That's fine. A delay is a delay. Here is where it gets interesting. Once we boarded this old DC plane the cabin crew promptly made an announcement that they had ""forgotten"" to load water to the tanks. So even though the flush would work there would be no water from the faucets to wash our hands. Instead there was just a bottle of water kept in the toilet. Yes that was my Delta experience! I met another traveler in Mexico a few days later who apparently flew the same flight two days later and had the same water issue. This really explains why I should avoid Delta in the future!

He told me he would put me on standby and directed me toward a gate. Lady at the gate told me I'd have to wait an hour till she could answer any of my questions. Went back to the desk an hour later and told that the man at the check in desk must have made a mistake and that I had not been put on standby. Lady then put me in standby and told me she would call my name if a seat opened up.

Booked seat from Florida to Atlanta but no seat booked from Atlanta to Seattle by agent and now on standby. Tried to assign seat over internet but was blocked because agent put me on standby. Called Delta and was informed that the airport agents now had control and could not book a seat. Told telephone agent to let me speak to supervisor as I was looking at 25 empty seats on their website. Agent spoke to supervisor and supervisor assigned me a seat. Now why couldn't other agent have done that hours earlier? Arrived at baggage check-on area (already had boarding passes) for ""red-eye"" return trip from Seattle. Stood in line watching understaffed agents for 20 minutes and was told when we finally got to the front of the line that we had missed the baggage check-in window by 3 minutes. Keep in mind we had already stood in line 20 minutes. Told to go to the Special Services line. Got in Special Services line and stood for 15 minutes. By now not only had my wife and I missed checking our bags but we had now missed the flight. Told by ""red coated"" Supervisor is that all they could do was put us on standby for a 11.25 pm ""red-eye"" flight with no guarantee we could even get on the plane as there were no seats available. As we pointed out how long we stood in their lines the ""red coat"" got surly and told us that this was our only choice. She would not help us with a room or meals. We asked about a trip the next day which she booked us on that left at 11.45 am. Now 13 hours later. When we asked where we could find a hotel she pointed the directions to the hotel board center and basically said we were on our own. The last straw was they lost our baggage on the return flight.

On the way back from Las Vegas we knew right away that our flight was going to miss the connection. I called Delta to try to get a connecting flight worked out and was on hold for around 45 minutes. Never did get it worked out over the phone. When we arrived in Atlanta they told us to go to a kiosk to find out what they had decided to do with us and a series of coupons came out. One for 25.00 of food (everything was closed) and a coupon for a hotel. On the flight back at 8 that morning the plane was packed and it looked like most had had the same kind of night we had. There were three stewardesses in the back of the plane talking so loud it kept waking everyone up. They did not provide a beverage service because of turbulence so they were non stop until I pushed my button and told them they were disturbing everyone. The girl was very rude and we heard her tell the other two we are talking too loud for the wonderful passengers out there! And went right back to their discussion.,,,Economy,,3,1,3,2,1,,,1,0

I don't know when they put the upgraded Airbus 330s into service but it's as good as any business service I've seen on a US carrier. 1-2-1 seating so if you're by the window you're not trapped if the person next to you is in full recline mode. In the usual 2-2-2 format I've always avoided the window but on this service the window seat at 9J worked very well. The seats are on the narrow side for business but you get an individual pod that's narrower in the front (where your feet go) wider in the back; the seats have full recline. Cabin staff on both flights were senior attentive and friendly. On AMS-BOS the genial captain came back before take-off to chat up everyone in business individually. I only used the A/V to track flight progress but the screen is large and pops out of the pod wall. The pillow was comfortable. The amenities kit is about average - the usual socks etc. but nothing special and they don't offer the business amenity that my wife really likes - PJ''s.,,,Business Class,,8,4,5,4,0,,,4,1
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Farouk Mogheth,Czech Republic,12/23/2013,"A combination of hit and miss but as its my first ""experience"" on a US airline and using the 3 major American legacy carriers Delta seems to have offered the most consistent service level even definitely seriously sub par compared to Asian and European carriers. Flew from Bangkok to Los Angeles through Tokyo Narita. Delta's service in Thailand and Japan far superior than on US soil. BKK-NRT with a B747 the seats were extremely thin. Cannot conceive sitting in such a seat all the way to LAX. From Tokyo Narita a comfortable B777. Flights on time entertainment acceptable with an OK selection of films. Food edible however spartan portions. Flew Delta Connection from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a very comfortable Embraer jet. Not happy about paying for checked in luggage. No other service on board. The return flight was a disappointment. Delta sold me a return routing from Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda and then 19 hours later from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok which I accepted assuming that the airline will assist in the transfer and accommodation. Delta refused to assist in any of the above thus I had to handle my own transfer between the airports as well for own accommodation and food. This is the main reason why I will be adamant in flying to the USA with a non local airline so only on European Asian or Middle Eastern airlines that would offer generally a far higher service levels. The ""comfort plus"" product is a laughable one from Delta. Trying to sell seats with better leg room however seats scattered in the cabin with no better seats dedicated cabin or special menu. So not recommending this wanna-be premium economy. On board staff did their job but surprised of how detached they were from the passengers.

After a one hour delay I was allowed to board the flight. We then proceed to sit on the runway for another hour and as a consequence I missed my connection. Once I landed in Minneapolis I was told (very abruptly and rudely) that I had missed the flight and was told to then search for my new boarding pass in amongst a sea of boarding passes of others who had also missed their flights because handing them out individually would have been too easy and maybe make sense? I then proceeded through the airport to the baggage reclaim and customer information area where I asked the Delta airlines representative whether there was any available food for people who had missed their flights. She told me that if I wanted something to eat I had to order a pizza. Last but not certainly not least when I was finally able to pick up my rucksack from the Delta ""office"" I was wearing a sling due to a shoulder injury. Delta staff in the office watched me struggle to pick up my backpack for around ten minutes before finally I actually had to ask them for help.

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,J Gardner,United States,12/20/2013,"DAL 417 LAX to SYD and DAL 16 from SYD to LAX. Both legs on Delta's 777-200LR in seat 7A. Used kiosk for check-in at both LAX and SYD. The Delta ""business class"" lounge at LAX is nothing more than Delta's normal ""Sky Club"" the facility was overcrowded and like being inside an extremely loud bar. The flights pushed back pretty much on time. Delta's 777-200LR is getting a bit worn looking and the herringbone ""suites"" that face away from the windows (as opposed to the much-better window-facing suites used by carriers like Cathay Pacific) had walls so low that privacy was minimal. I was lucky enough to have seat 7A on both flights; 7A has the advantage of having a closet next to the seat which in effect forms a cave that the seat reclines back into. The set-up is very good for allowing sleep. The flight crews were LA-based both directions seemed to be made up of senior FA's and on balance did a really nice service both directions. The flights featured three meal services - dinner/lunch a mid-flight snack and a light breakfast. The forward and mid galleys had a variety of low end snacks available throughout the flight. The AVOD system is OK (screen sizer and location) but nothing special but it does have available a fairly broad selection of movies. The best part of the flights was my ability to sleep. I am a large guy and I've had real trouble trying to sleep in the flat-bed first and business seats used by British Air Cathay Pacific and Qantas. Delta was a refreshing change. I got 7-8 solid hours of quality sleep time on both flights. Part of the reason is that the FA's move the meal service process along efficiently and get the cabin lights down early into the flight. On arrival although Delta offers BusinessElite passengers a fast-track immigration/customs pass I didn't use them because as a TSA Global Entry cardholder I was able to use the kiosks in both Sydney and LAX. As I only had carryons the total time from plane until I was out of the airport could not have been more than 10 minutes. In the past I've normally flown on Qantas to/from Australia and New Zealand but with Delta's codeshare arrangement with Virgin Australia (an excellent carrier by the way in all respects) and given my outstanding recent experience on Delta's 777 I plan to continue using Delta for my travel to/from Oceania.",,,Business Class,,8,4,5,3,4,,,4,1

In general all my flights departed on schedule and on certain occasions even arrived at my destination ahead of schedule. I can safely say that since the last time I flew DL about 2 years ago I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of service. Overall flying experience was very pleasant. Although a lot of the cabin crew are senior I found most to be a lot nicer compared to the grumpy ones in the past. One noticeable improvement was upon boarding. The boarding gate staff are all friendly with special mention to the ones in ATL and JFK T4. They make it a point to greet all passengers by name and with genuine smiles. I was quite impressed by the staff at JFK T4 who took extra time to guide me through the check-in process using the kiosks. They were very helpful and not in a rushed manner. In-flight food on the long-haul flights were decent enough. For the short-haul flights I was able to have as much nuts and pretzels as I want. IFE was pretty good with and easy interface and lots of options to choose from. I thought of trying the premium economy seats and though I'm 6'0"" tall and a little on the heavy side I still didn't find it of much value considering the add-on fee. I really didn't feel much of a difference compared to regular Y. I also found the new seats to be slightly more comfortable and didn't feel as cramped as before. Moreover I've been lucky enough to have entire rows of 3 to myself on most of the flights I took particularly the long-haul ones. It took a bit work checking seat assignments on a regular basis but the effort was well worth.

He looked up another potential flight and asked if we were able to make it to a flight that should have been boarding as we spoke. So it seemed unlikely that we would make it but it was delayed. So we rush to get to that flight make it to our next stop and are now hours early for our next flight. We head over to Delta and ask if there is any way possible to leave on an earlier flight home because it was not in our plan to be so early and sit at an airport for 5 hours.

While these flights are branded as Delta they are operated by Compass. I must say that this is an excellent product! My flight to SFO which left at 7.00am left on time and arrived early. In addition a light breakfast snack was served. This flight was half full so I asked for and was given an extra snack to take with me. This kind gesture saved me from having to purchase lunch later. The flight back left SFO at 5.00pm and arrived back on time. This flight was full but the same professional service was received. That being said a snack and drink service helped make a really long day end well. These flights are operated by EMB 175 planes and there are no middle seats only window or aisle. Besides the great price service and on time performance I would recommend this trip as there are assigned seats and clearing security at the Delta terminals in LAX and SFO is much quicker than the Southwest terminals at each airport.

Flight booked in May for a 13/12 return. One month after booking the return ATL-MAN was cancelled by Delta. Automatically rebooked on a flight for the following day. Delta refused point blank to compensate for the inconvenience and extra nights accommodation. As such we chose to fly back a day earlier then our original plans. My request for compensation was a free upgrade from economy to economy plus on the return Atlantic flight. Simply had the terms and conditions quoted to me. Online check in is a joke. Had seats allocated together on each flight but on clicking the change seat option you will find all other seats marked as unavailable. Options were available to upgrade however at a cost. Our expectations for the flight were therefore low on boarding. However both pleasantly surprised with the flight and service. Transatlantic flight on a B767-300 which featured personal seat back TVs. Good choice although the music channels were a little mainstream for my preference. Food more than OK. Plenty of soft drinks offered and alcohol with the main meal. The return flight was on an older model and featured overhead TVs which didn't matter too much as it was an overnight flight and a good hour shorter in travel time than outward. Both internal flights on a B757-200 were adequate. Seat pitch for all four flights was fine typical of an economy flight. Professional cabin crew on all sectors flown. Touch of humour with the Christmas 2013 flight safety video - certainly kept you watching it. All four flights were full in all cabins all had on time departures and arrivals.

Delta's refurbished 767-300ERs are a vast improvement on the previous cabin - they're now even nicer than the ex-Northwest A330s. The legroom in economy comfort is such that at 201cm tall I didn't feel cramped at all and the reading light actually lets you read without eyestrain. My only beef here is that the IFE was virtually unviewable because of the constant stream of PA announcements throughout the flight that kept pausing it. After an hour of trying to watch a movie I'd only seen about 20 minutes of actual footage and when someone came on the PA yet again to tell me in French that Delta extends a special welcome to Skyteam partners etc. I gave up and read a book.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,4,2,,,3,1

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,B Walberer,United States,11/29/2013,SFO-ATL-LIM return in regular economy. I got a great deal from SFO to LIM. My overall experience was good. Service on the domestic legs was better than expected with friendly crews and regular drink runs. The crew also responded to the flight attendant button rather promptly. The weak point was the flight from ATL to LIM which was an older plane without personal IFE. However the LIM-ATL flight was on a more modern plane with IFE and plenty of movie choices all free of charge. Food was ok not great but edible and of sufficient quantity. No free alcohol even on international flights to/from LIM. Transfer in ATL was easy with airline representatives at the gate to assist passengers in the transfer process. Would recommend especially if one can get a good deal.,,,Economy,,7,4,5,3,4,,,5,1

The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The plane was full and they were kept busy but they really made my daughters feel special giving them extra cookies drinks passing chat etc. Even when one woman decided to go to the restroom a few seconds before takeoff - a potentially serious situation - they were firm but polite as they leaped down the aisle to make her sit down. IFE worked on all seats and while a couple of inches of extra legroom wouldn't have gone amiss it was fine for a six hour flight. A word about the meals. I've noticed many times that the catering supplied by European companies (ie going out) is far superior to what you get coming back from the USA regardless of airline. But that's the only criticism really. Well done Delta. In my experience you're at least as good as BA KLM and Virgin.,,,Economy,,9,3,5,4,5,,,5,1

The only reason I booked the particular flight (red eye) was because of the 1st class seat options. At that time there were a considerable number of 1st class seats open. I checked in via mobile 24 hours before-no issues. Got through security-still no issues. When I went to board the plane I was told when they scanned my boarding pass that I'd been downgraded to Economy (not even Economy Comfort) because I was on a complimentary upgrade. I explained that absolutely was not the case and that I'd specifically booked the flight as a 1st class ticket. The response I received at that point was that ""Corporate did it because of an equipment change we don't know the criteria they used and we can't change it."" I took it up to the most senior person I could at the gate and got the same generic answer. I used to be a huge proponent of Delta and have defended them countless times to friends.

So why is it that all the other carriers let the military check one bag up to 100lbs no we are not getting over this is the bag that we transport our gear in. The gear that we use to take the fight to the enemy. Come on Delta get with the program and stop trying to make an extra buck off the military. I guess that's why the military generally uses American Airlines first and Delta only as a last resort.

I cannot believe KLM/Air France have partnered with Delta and I'm afraid I'm unlikely to continue patronising that group unless I'm sure I'm not flying on a Delta staffed plane. The service was just appalling. The seats in economy were very poor. The underseat space was cramped by some electrical equipment and also very hot as a result.

The food was also excellent on the outward flight being a vegetarian I requested a special meal and was served minted peas with wild rice and marinated tofu along with a bread roll cheese and crackers and a dessert. Then just before landing we were served Calzone. They certainly don't let you go hungry! On the return journey however the main dish was pasted and vegetables which wasn't to my liking at all but it was a late night flight and I wasn't particularly hungry anyway breakfast then consisted of a cereal bar and a banana. The only gripes I have are that the leg room is cramped - but where isn't it these days! With regard to the on board entertainment whilst having an excellent selection of content was somewhat slow and sluggish and even required re-starting on the return flight. On the ground baggage arrived promptly and check in was also efficient at both airports with staff being courteous and professional. Both flights left before the scheduled departure time and arrived well before their scheduled arrival time in both cases even though on the outward flight there was a delay in passengers boarding.

We only take on to the flight my husband's CPAP my purse his small back pack with his meds and my carry-on shoulder bag. All these items fit under the seat in front of us. On our way back people had these ""carry on"" suitcases and one woman had 2! Neither of which fit under the seat. I had a man beside me with a large backpack that he did not stow. He left it standing under his legs. As a result his foot was under the seat in front of me! Where are my feet supposed to go? He should have been told to either stow this backpack in the overhead bins if it did not fit under the seat. Then to add injury to insult I was going to put my umbrella into the overhead and was told that it may impede stowing suitcases! When the service came around I asked for a Bloody Mary mix no ice. The flight attendant complained that this would take more than half a can I don't want ice as it waters down the drink and it's cooled enough. I check all airlines to find the best price I can find.

First time experiencing flying with Delta and it was very disappointing. Like previous comments booked ticket through KLM/Air France where we have always receive a brilliant service. Wondering why they have partnered with Delta to lower their standards. Flight from London to Minneapolis ever so rude cabin crew. Nobody at the entrance to welcome the passengers and direct them to their seats. Not a single smile and very abrupt cabin crew members. The only good thing was they had a good selection of entertainment at least it kept our mind away from their rudeness. Food selection was average. Flight from Minneapolis - Las Vegas more friendly crew and drinks were offered regularly and adequately which made us really surprise for a domestic flight compared to the opposite for the international flight. On our way back at the airport in Las Vegas when checking in again not a single smile from the ground crew or any welcome. Flight from Las Vegas - Atlanta was fine and crew friendly and adequate snacks and drinks served. International flight from Atlanta - London we were welcome this time at the entrance and were directed to our seat. An unpleasant surprise was waiting for me as soon as I popped down the seat tray in front of me to read. Yes it was messy with food stain and dry sauce on it from the previous flight and has not been clean which put me off eating. I requested it to be cleaned which was done pretty much straight away but no apologies whatsoever from the cabin crew.

As in the last I have nothing but praise for Delta. Check- ins with lots of excess/oversized luggage were most efficient and very quick indeed. The ground staff at both terminals were polite well trained and accommodating. The self check-in computers in LAX were very intuitive and easy to use. Both flights were on time. Inflight service was excellent. Flying the return route in the back of economy I noted how little wait there was for meals after the service had started. Again the service was not only quick but accommodating and compared very well to Singapore; my personal benchmark. The food was fine for economy class airline fare. The entertainment options were comprehensive. Perhaps the airline could upgrade its earphones a little. Seating was comfortable. The Comfort Economy which I used on the outward bound trip was well and truly worth the money. Most importantly Delta has its own terminal at LAX; meaning you avoid the general admissions hall. This is an excellent reason in itself to choose the airline on the SYD-LAX route.,,,Economy,,10,4,5,5,5,,,5,1

I have just travelled on Delta from South Africa to Atlanta. Both the ground staff and cabin staff were appalling. Gives rudeness a whole new meaning. Do Delta train staff to be so rude or is this a criterion for selection to Delta staff. We were offered no headphones. After 45 mins of attempting to get the cabin crew attention we were finally given a broken set of earphones. We again had great difficulty in getting their attention in getting another set. There was no choice of wines. Just a glass of box wine. We asked for a large bottle of water as my colleague and I drink a great deal en route. We were told that this is not allowed! We were assured that cabin crew would pace the plane with offers of drinks all night. Not only was this absolutely not the case but again it was virtually possible to get their attention at any stage of the night. The supper was moderate. The ""breakfast"" was probably the worst meal I have had on a flight ever. It was accompanied by a literally frozen salad so one had to chomp the ice off.

All flights except one on time great service provided by cabin crew. On long haul flights hot towels were offered which is very nice touch. Great food and beverages.

Both Manchester flights on A330 very comfortable seating is 2x4x2 with each seat having its own inflight entertainment. Other sectors on A319/b737. Service on all the flights was excellent very friendly staff. A lot better than American. Reserved seats together on all flights when booking saved a lot of problems at check in. Transfer in Atlanta was quick and efficient well within 90 minutes suggested. Flights were a good deal.,,,Economy,,9,4,5,4,4,,,5,1

DL 9497 and DL0239 with ATL to AUS DL 0686. I prefer Delta when flying American carriers and they're my no. 2 choice for all airlines Air France being my no. 1. In a trip this month to France flying into Nice I would have few complaints. An issue I've not encountered before rather two issues are the problem of the midplane lavatories next to the exit row seats and Deltas food service. I'll leave it to the reader to figure the issues with the lavatories and in fairness it should be an issue for all airlines flying the 767. Food however is a real issue. I have never had worse airline food than these two trips. When a convenience store Hot Pocket rates over Delta's offerings there is a real problem.,,,Premium Economy,,8,3,3,1,5,,,4,1
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,M Whiley,United Kingdom,9/29/2013,LHR-JFK-LAX-LHR (via Detroit). I purchased the tickets for almost £300 cheaper then the British Airways / Virgin Atlantic equivalent - and it was money well saved! To JFK had great pitch in 767 economy great food drink and snacks and the on demand touch screen entertainment meant the flight went really quick. All the internal flights were on 757s and they were as equally as good and all had touch screen on demand entertainment which I wasn't expecting. It's right to say that American airlines have a bad reputation but my perception has changed and when I come back to the USA next year I will fly delta. The product is on par if not better then the other airlines and would recommend them.,,,Economy,,10,4,5,5,5,,,5,1
delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Oyinlola Fashina,United States,9/29/2013,I have been a gold member for at least one year. I usually fly every 4 to 6 weeks from DCA to Lagos Nigeria. The food service is extremely poor. Breakfast is disappointing I have now learnt to eat before flying. The airline assumes everyone can eat the cheesy bread served in the AM the rice has practically no taste and the bathrooms are in such a bad state before we land. I have only been upgraded twice on the economy flights. I ask each time and the response is the same 'you may or may not be upgraded and you will be told at the gate'. I flew Air France on the trip before last and even got upgraded on that flight to economy comfort. Delta really does need to appreciate their gold members. I fly delta because of convenience but I'm beginning to think it may not be worth it. Bad food with no absolutely no fringe benefits is quite frustrating especially when other airlines offer much more. To fly long distance every 4 to 6 weeks with no benefits are not worth it.,,,Economy,,5,3,3,1,4,,,3,0

delta-air-lines,Delta Air Lines customer review,Betty Pentier,United Kingdom,9/22/2013,I had flown to SFO from LHR trip with Air France which was fantastic. My return flight with Delta was anything but. SFO-ATL then to LHR. Flight to ATL was really bad. The seats were uncomfortable and old. The cabin crew were average at the best of times. There was no food unless you wanted to pay $10 for a box of candy and potato chips. The inflight entertainment was terrible - there were about 3 free things to watch - everything else had to paid for. After already paying a lot of money for a flight airlines then try and nickel and dime you for things like entertainment and food. Next was ATL-LHR. This was no better. Seats were uncomfortable and cramped. I'm only 5'2 and even I was uncomfortable. Entertainment was not great although a step up from the last. The fact that there was no personal controller really irritated me. When the screen is unresponsive the last thing I want to do on a long flight is have my arm up constantly hitting the screen just to get something to work. The cabin crew again were just average. The food was pretty bad and bland. The PA announcements were hard to hear and were of terrible quality. Overall it was a terrible experience. The only good thing about the flight was their safety/welcome video! This was actually well thought out and funny - I actually took notice of it and watched the whole thing on both flights. Too bad they don't put that much thought and effort in to the actual flying part.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

We even received a free drink and snack. My husband watched football.

They rescheduled me on a flight 7 hours later, and I found a flight on another airline. The return was on Jetblue. When I went online to select a seat, I was presented with a grand total of 0 seats from which to chose without paying the upgrade fee. How could there be 0 seats when I don't have one?  Next flight planned a couple of weeks in advance. Go online to pick a seat -  0 seats available! I don't get a seat until I get to the airport - last row, middle seat. On the return leg, I go online again and zip. So I call customer service. After 10 minutes on hold, I explain and am told that it's because I got on the site late. Well, it's not a problem, you'll get a seat. Sure I will, last row, middle, perhaps? After a few minutes of snarky attitude I ask for a supervisor.

I was initially confused and frustrated by the online check in process - they assign seats upon arrival at the gate, and you can only reserve online if you wish to pay for 'More Space' seats in advance. Both the phone and Twitter operatives were helpful when I raised this with them. We arrived at the gate with about an hour to spare, gate staff could not have been more helpful. We asked to have two seats together and were told that this would be resolved once the staff had logged in. 15 minutes later, we were called to the desk and found that we had been assigned to More Legroom at no extra cost. We were delighted with this and the seats were very comfortable. We also loved the DirectTv and Sirius Radio live streaming to the aircraft, a unique touch. The unlimited soft drinks and snacks were appreciated. The flight staff were attentive and approachable. The captain coming out to make the pre-flight briefing personally was a great touch. There was an on-ground delay of an hour due to bad weather in Washington, but the captain kept us fully informed of everything that was going on and since they had the foresight to switch the entertainment on prior to take-off (why doesn't every airline do that), we barely noticed.

It was our first vacation in 3 years, and my dad saved up 3 years worth of vacation days for this trip. They offered to give us Jetblue vouchers. Period. Our hotel, rental car, and vacation plan fees were thrown down the toilet, and they only offered vouchers. Like I'll ever ride on Jetblue again. Also, they acted like they were doing a huge favor by saying our delayed flight was paid by them. We didn't get a refund so we just paid for a later flight. This infuriated me and I tried to explain that it wasn't free for us, and the woman from Jetblue kept saying it was paid by them. So I asked if I could get a refund for the original flight and they said no. I was so mad but couldn't cancel because of the fees for hotel, car, food, and other reservations weren't refundable.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Jon Anthony,United States,7/2/2015,"Comically mismanaged operation. Problems began when the departure gate was mobbed- seems an earlier flight had 'technical problems', so it departed an hour late at my original gate. We were then redirected to an alternate gate, and waited. And waited. And waited. They now had us waiting on the plane with 'technical problems' and they basically had the other flight go out with our intended jet, and we were stuck. It took text message from my daughter thousands of miles away to inform me the flight was finally cancelled. Not one word from JetBlue staff at the boarding gate. Finally, 2 hours after scheduled departure, they announced baggage was at the carousel, and ""being monitored by JetBlue associates"" I went down to claim my bag - no JetBlue staff in sight. I quickly went to ticketing, got an apology and refund from the embarrassed support staff, and proceeded to Southwest, where I ended up having to pay +$500 more for their next direct flight with a confirmed seat. I understand this is a mechanical industry and there will be problems, but it's how an airline manages the problem that is a mark of their business integrity and customer focus.

Our flight took off 20 min early so we arrived early. During the flight, we were quickly offered snacks and a drink. The attendant came around selling ear buds for $5 to use with the TV at each seat. Having your own TV made the flight enjoyable. At the end of the flight, deplaning was just as pleasant. The price was also better than anyone else, and there were no problems with my luggage.

Both flights left on time and we arrived at both destinations about 30 minutes early. The crew on the flight was attentive and very friendly. Both on the way to New York and back to SF they asked us about ourselves and our trip. The A321 they fly on trans con flights has a snack bar they open up after they come through with the first round of drinks. It's great being able to get up and get your own snacks without having to call a flight attendant. The entertainment was pretty standard they have live TV and movies you can purchase for $5.

We didn't sense that the crew enjoyed their jobs. The entertainment controls did not function on either of our seats. We were not able to take advantage of the entertainment. On the return leg of our trip the crew was marginally better.

Quick to take-off so was must not have lost our slot. Crew was above par and standard Jetblue entertainment product and snacks. At least one lady in the row in front of me had a TV that did not work so they reset the system. Not a big deal but if you purchased content and already watching that would be a huge pain.

As we were making travel arrangements to return back to the Miami area JetBlue had the only flight that worked with our time schedule. We were hesitant to book the flight with JetBlue because we did not know much about the company. We decided to give JetBlue a chance and booked flight #578 from SFO to FLL on March 14 2015. It is unfortunate that we did not have a good experience on our first JetBlue flight. The electrical system had issues. The TV on the back of the seats worked at the beginning of the flight but slowly the TVs started going out throughout the cabin (our row did not have a working TV the majority of the 5 hour flight). This made me question what other electrical issues this plane might have. Not only did we have electrical issues but we did not have running water on the flight. My husband and I are both in the medical field and we feel this is not only inconvenient but unsanitary. The ""solution"" was to place multiple bottles of water in the restroom for customers to wash their hands. Partially used and soiled water bottles to wash our hands is not exactly our idea of sanitary. Since the plane did not have running water my husband and I decided to avoid using the restroom for over a 5 hour flight. It also made us question the cleanliness of the flight attendants' hands provided the lack of water on the plane.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Darlagiannis Anna,United States,3/9/2015,I chose JetBlue because I heard great things. I think I had an unlucky streak in which both of my flights were delayed. One being a leaky valve and the second due to weather (out-of-JetBlues control). JetBlue worked really hard to keep me happy and remain their customer. They provided me a credit no questions asked since the delays affected my transportation routes. For them to do that shows that this type of thing does not happen very often. I will also say that the unlimited snacks beverages not to mention all the leg room was a plus. Although I did not have a perfect experience I would definitely recommend JetBlue. Things happen but JetBlue owns up to it and works hard to keep you a satisfied customer. I respect that and their business model of good customer service. I bet if I didn't have the delays the experience would have been perfect.,,,Economy,,6,5,5,5,5,,,4,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,R Sindler,United States,2/24/2015,We just did the Jetblue Mint experience LAX to JFK. We are a couple of airline geeks who took this flight as a Valentines Day gift to each other. Our dedicated Mint flight crew greeted us warmly during boarding including a welcome card with their names. Also waiting at our seats were eye masks and bottled water. Before takeoff we each enjoyed a couple of their delicious signature drinks (they're small). After takeoff we were offered more drinks a Birchbox full of gender specific spa products and dinner. Out of 5 or 6 items we were permitted to choose 3 small plates an appetizer and dessert. Honestly I found some of the food excellent and some not quite as good. They were more than happy to replace one of my choices that I wasn't too happy with. The entertainment was great live TV and free wifi. The movies are not on-demand which made it so that I wasn't able to watch one because I was too distracted with the rest of the Mint experience to pay attention to the start times. In case dinner doesn't fill you the A321 has a self-serve snack bar behind the Mint cabin for anytime bagged snacks and drinks. The seats themselves were comfortable for a 5 hour domestic flight. I liked the firmness controls and massage feature. We sat in a 2 seat bank so we could sit together but the single suites looked very nice for people traveling alone. The single seats have more personal space and a privacy door too. Jetblue really thought our the Mint product well. If you book enough in advance the introductory price is a terrific value. Even last minute bookings still price Mint competitively with UA DL and AA on this route.,,,Business Class,,10,5,5,4,4,,,5,1

We were finally on the plane when the flight was cancelled due to weather. The flight would have made it if we had left on time (the DC airport closed at 1.00 pm). I was rebooked for a new flight the following day. The flight left at 1.00 pm took me to Boston then arrived in DC at 10.00pm. (My original flight was direct.) I was told the airline would not provide accommodations for the night because it was a weather and not a technical difficulty that cancelled the flight of course the weather only became an issue because of the technical difficulty. I went back to the airport early the following morning and was able to book a direct flight to DC that departed at 6.55. I tried to fly standby on the two earlier flight without success. Although this is terrible the worst part was the gate agents. They didn't have the decency to tell me that the flight was full and just walked away from the desk after boarding the flight. Then when I checked in for my 6.55 flight (I hadn't been assigned a seat that morning) they were rude again. I will not fly JetBlue again.,,,,,,4,1,3,3,,,3,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,C Walsh,Canada,1/19/2015,Flew jetBlue Mint class New York to LA and return. Overall a great experience. Was seated in 2A one of four 'single suites.' Very comfortable and private especially when reclined with the suite door closed. The only picky comment is there tends to be some wasted space owing to the single seat configuration and the design could have accommodated a greater seat width. You're also removed from the window so mindless gazing is not really an option unless you unbuckle and lean. The perks in Mint are outstanding not just the lie-flat seat with massage feature but the food and beverage selection amenity kit service from the flight staff and the large video screen. As mentioned in previous reviews not touch screen but that didn't really detract from the experience - you couldn't even reach the screen necessarily when fully reclined. Okay selection of feature films but not VOD. The DirecTV feed is great however and really gives no reason to claim you're bored. The wi-fi complimentary at the moment was hit and miss; fairly good responsiveness when working but did suffer from numerous interruptions. Personalized and attentive service was prominent on both legs and flight time seemingly flew (no pun intended) by. At the current introductory price point Mint is outstanding value. Inevitably jetBlue will adjust their fare pricing to reflect the reality of what is offered however even at a higher cost Mint class should be seriously considered before looking at intercontinental business class on other airlines. jetBlue and its staff should be proud of the Mint product and I will look for any excuse to fly Mint class again.,,,,,10,5,5,5,5,,,5,1

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,S Adlam,United States,1/14/2015,JFK-LAX. Mint Service. Like other reviews of this new First Class Jet blue service it is excellent. Overall it ranked higher than most excellent business class carriers and felt more like BA First which I had just flew in on. The level of the service is high as well as the experience. Meals are better than most carriers and was completely impressed. What I liked the most was the Suite which was private and comfortable with plenty of room for a bed with great bedding. Was completely surprised by this level of service in US. The only downside was the movies were not running but there was plenty of other options. The amenities kit and head set are all top notch. They give American and Virgin a run for the money and considering this service is so well priced I will be flying again!,,,,,10,5,5,5,4,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,H Christmas,Australia,1/5/2015,In December 2014 I took two separate jetBlue flights one from SFO to JFK and then another from JFK to LAX. These flights were fairly long (5 hours) and I found the service to be quite sterile and mediocre. While it was nice that snacks and drinks were made available throughout the flight there were no healthy options aside from water and if you were not prepared to purchase a meal on board chips and cookies were basically your only options for the flight. I feel that this is standard for a flight that may be 1 or 2 hours long but for a longer 5 hour trip I expect there to be meal service included in the price of the fare. I also suffered from severe pain in my right ear during and after landing on both these flights which I had not experienced on another domestic US flight with a different airline that I had taken around the same time nor on any other flight I have had prior or after these two jetBlue ones.,,,,,6,5,4,3,4,,,3,0

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Michael Mo,China,12/18/2014,JFK-IAD ERJ-195 The seat is nice and provides enough legroom. It was a short flight of about 50 minutes. There were personal TV which is good enough for a short flight. You can switch channels to news such as CNN. The flight has snacks and cola for complimentary. It is the best experience I have had on short flight.,,,,,9,4,3,4,5,,,4,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,R Gibson,United States,12/10/2014,"R/T JFK to LIR (Liberia Costa Rica) in Even More Space seats. The EMS seats entitle you to shorter waiting time at the TSA checkpoint which we needed since we were a little late arriving to JFK. We purchased food to bring on board but ""boxes"" are availlable. No Eat Up Cafe (fresh food) is sold on this flight. The EMS seats have lots of leg room which is great. Our flight attendants both ways were friendly and efficient and complimentary snacks and beverages available at all times. Since we were on an international flight the movies were free but they charge $3 for headphones (which I feel JB should comp for the EMS rows). Overall a great experience. We use this service twice annually to visit our home in CR.",,,,,10,4,5,0,4,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,S Johnson,United Kingdom,11/20/2014,Flew between New York JFK and Fort Myers. Checked in online and bag drop at JFK was quick and easy.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,C Samuel,Thailand,11/3/2014,Flew Mint Class from LAX to JFK and were impressed with the overall experience. We live in Asia and fly Business or First Class on some fantastic full service Asian based airlines but this Jetblue Mint experience can easily beat most of them. We took the 7am flight on a heavy 100 percent full A321 flight. The check in was smooth with a nice welcome from the ground staff. Our luggage were slightly oversize and above the max. 50 pounds allowance per piece but they were flexible on it hence we didn't need to pay the additional fees. We arrived around 5.30 am hence only a few passengers on the security check and didn't bother to use the express line. The boarding was announced at 6:15 am and the Mint passengers got to board first. We were seated in 3A and 3C which is perfect for couple even though the single suite with sliding door in front and the back of our seats row 2 and 4 were more private. The cabin crew were very helpful in explaining the Mint service seat functions and presented us with menu card. The welcome drink with or without vodka were a delight. It took us a while to learn the full features of the seat as they are so unique and not the usual features you find in other carriers. The thick blanket noise canceling headphones power point container for your phones and sunglasses are very thoughtful. The boarding was completed before 7am and the departure was on time. We got to choose 3 out of five meals prepared by Saxon+Parole which were delicious and nicely presented. The Icecream by blue marble and Mah Ze Dahr cookies in a box were of good quality. One feature we love the most is free and fast wifi as soon as we took off. The non stop TV entertainment although not AVOD was cool and we could watch it as soon as we sat down. The in-massage seat function helped us to relax and dozing off for most 5 hours and 30 minutes flight. I am 6 feet tall and I found the seat is comfortable and I was able to stretch flat out. We arrived at JFK 10 minutes earlier than scheduled and were very happy with our experience. Book early for extreme good value and highly recommend the Mint class to anyone looking for a fantastic First class experience at an affordable price.,,,,,10,5,5,5,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,B Martin,United States,10/22/2014,HPN-MCO. No complaints seats were roomy. Check in was easy both ways. Great entertainment as you could actually watch live TV. No meals offered (short flight). Basic refreshments. Good value!,,,,,9,5,5,0,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,M Lydecker,United States,10/22/2014,Took flight 1834 from Port-au-Prince to JFK on 10/17/14. What a great experience - almost. The personnel were exceptional. They did everything right. My seat was 1D since no one was in the exit row seats they let me move back and allowed my friend in coach to move next to me he is 6 ft 3 so that was great for him. The attendants were on their game the whole trip and got me coffee after their normal serving time without a hitch. Only problem was my seat sound connection crackled so I used the seat connection next to me. No problem as long as no one is directly next to you.,,,Business Class,,10,5,5,5,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,R Mackinnon,United States,10/20/2014,I travel a fair amount (7-10 trips a year for biz and pleasure). I am fine with zero amenties for short hauls but I am sorry Boston - San Diego is a long flight. I paid $90 extra for leg room and was still jammed in like a sardine. There was nothing to eat except junk food (salt or sugar) or a cardboard sandwich for purchase. No free wine or beer. If I wanted a cheap blanket and pillow for the red-eye home I had to BUY it (and then had to own it) - I traveled to this business meeting with one carry on - what am I supposed to do with my new jetblue bedding? Talk about a throwaway anti-environmental business model. I had to pay for TV if I wanted it - only good thing is free wifi. I paid over $900 for the ticket. Jet Blue should not treat their transcontinental flyers like this. I would not recommend JB to anyone taking a trip longer than 90 minutes and I would only use them again if I could find no other carrier going to the destination.,,,,,4,2,4,1,1,,,3,0

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,D Cohen,United States,9/28/2014,We arrived at the airport before 2pm - our flight was at 9.45 pm. Usually when you arrive so far in advance JetBlue try to accommodate you on an earlier flight with no charge. We had the chance to take the flight at 2.40pm JetBlue had space on that flight but they wanted to charge $50 per person (group of 4) instead they put us on stand by for 7 hours.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Brian Lally,United States,9/28/2014,I recently traveled round trip from Boston to Orlando. I traveled out of Boston on September 14 2014 and we were about 20 minutes delayed leaving Boston due to the late arrival of the inbound flight. I have to say it was a great flight and the pilot made up time arriving in Orlando for an on-time arrival the crew were great plenty of legroom plenty of drinks and snacks. The overall flight to Orlando was excellent. Coming home to Boston yesterday was a different story the male flight attendant on the Orlando-Boston route was extremely rude. No smile as we boarded the aircraft no hello to the passengers just miserable. I traveled with 2 friends on board the flight and the tray table was defective and the soda went all over my friends pants. I went to ask this flight attendant for some paper towels and he rudely said get back to your seat because there was turbulence. I understand the safety protocols when it comes to turbulence but at least take initiative to the passengers requests. There was no apology from him for this defective tray table. A female flight attendant who was so nice came to our aid.,,,,,4,5,2,3,4,,,5,1

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,J Harris,Australia,9/9/2014,Flew LAX-JFK return in Mint in Aug/Sep 2014. Check in was fast and efficient although slightly hard to find the Mint line at JFK. The food is some of the best I've had inflight and beats any of the other American airlines I've flown hands down. The seat was slightly narrow but the adjustable firmness and subtle massage made up for it. Warm and efficient friendly cabin crew were very helpful but unobtrusive. Flight to JFK departed 50 minutes late but landed on time. Entertainment system is not on demand and the DirecTV has so many advertisements it is infuriating. The feature movies were ad free though. Overall a very good airline who I would definitely fly with again.,,,,,10,5,5,5,3,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Milo Diesel,United Kingdom,9/6/2014,Flew on Jet Blue 1732 from Bermuda to JFK on Sunday 31/8/2014. Boarding was speedy well organised and efficient with everyone boarded and the plane doors closed 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The flight left Bermuda 15 minutes early and arrived into JFK 25 minutes early which impressed me a lot. Service provided by three polite smiling and delightful crew with drinks and snack run done fairly effortlessly and refills available and delivered with extra ice and a smile. An impressive service that I really rated.,,,,,9,4,5,4,5,,,4,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Clear Brian,United States,8/28/2014,"I'm writing about JetBlue's check-in operations at Fort Lauderdale airport. Apparently they have grown their operations there with insufficient and / or unmotivated staff. Trying to check in a bag for a recent flight to JFK took 45 minutes finally being called out of the line and being told ""you are too late"". All this while the lines got longer and their staff stood around chatting. Out of 13 desks 6 were open while I counted at least 9 JetBlue staff hanging around doing nothing except chat. Finally got to the gate only for their personnel there not having a clue about getting passengers onboard in a logical order. They need to up their game at FLL or this passenger will be using another carrier next time. On board service was good friendly and helpful which did mitigate some of the bad feeling about the FLL ground experience.",,,,,4,4,2,4,4,,,4,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Milo Diesel,United Kingdom,8/28/2014,I flew on flight 1731 from JFK to Bermuda. The flight was delayed so boarding started around 30 minutes late. Boarding was pretty chaotic as the PA system was not working properly. Onboard we were greeted by a friendly cabin supervisor who smiled and asked us how we were. Once seated the flight was airborne within 20 minutes an hour later than scheduled. Inflight service was efficient and friendly with drinks served individually from a tray rather than a trolley which was a nice touch with a free snack served from a basket. Landing cards were handed out - it would be great if they had a supply of pens. The flight then arrived around 30 minutes late into Bermuda disembarkment was quick - and I have to say I really enjoyed the flight.,,,,,9,4,5,4,4,,,4,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,F Boulos,United States,8/28/2014,August 20 2014 flight 124. We flew from LAX to JFK on Mint. I can honestly say that I was very impressed! I have flown business class on many international airlines and the on-board service was comparable in every way. The food was excellent - best I have had on any airline. Flight attendants were friendly courteous and very attentive and our bags were the first to arrive at the carousel as promised. Furthermore the seats reclined to a flat position. All in all a great trip. The one suggestion for JetBlue is to have a small lounge area to accommodate Mint customers at larger airports such as LAX.,,,,,10,4,5,5,0,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,G Bradley,United Kingdom,8/26/2014,Aug 17 New York (JFK) to Orlando Intl (MCO) Flight 883. First time I've flown with JetBlue and it was not a pleasant experience. Told the flight delayed 15 minutes then another 15 minutes and so on. The plane was at the wrong terminal and took them over an hour to get it to the right gate! Boarding process was a farce very slow. 'Snack' was a packet of Doritos served by miserable cabin crew. De-boarding also very slow and then waited ages for our luggage. Only good points were that we got there in one piece and they have good leg room.,,,,,1,4,2,2,2,,,3,0

So I paid an extra $150 for my children and I to upgrade only to find out that I paid $150 for approximately a foot and a half extra leg room. I would have never spent my hard earned money on that and I believe that should've been explained to me. I will never fly jetBlue again.,,,,,,3,4,3,3,,,1,0

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,E Irgens,Norway,7/29/2014,Flew Mint class from LAX to JFK in July. Check in and boarding smooth and on time. Fantastic crew helpful and kind yet unobtrusive. Meal some of the best I've had inflight much better than BA and QR business long haul. Entertainment system not AVOD so whenever announcements were made I'd miss parts of the film I was watching. Good selection of entertainment though wifi never worked. Seat was the suite-style and very comfortable in all positions but surprisingly narrow in lie-flat. When trying to sleep I had to keep my arms over my chest like a mummy.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,T Nolen,United States,7/22/2014,Was flying for work from Tampa to DC and back. Good direct connection into Reagan at good prices so went for it. The flight to DC was uneventful and pleasant. A week later as I am returning I have checked in at DC and waiting at the gate when I get an email from my booking service provider 10 minutes before boarding time that my flight is cancelled. No announcements at the gate or anything. It just now has been changed from Tampa to Boston. 25 minutes later they announce to go to another gate to see attendants for help. After waiting nearly an hour to talk to the agents I am greeted by two very unhelpful or sympathetic agents. Our flight was cancelled because there was a mechanical failure on the plane scheduled for Boston so they used the Tampa plane instead. This information came from other customers in line who got it from their booking agents - not the Jetblue agents serving us. They tell me they can get me out two days later and if I want to get to Tampa the next day my best option is to cancel the return leg and book another flight with another airline as JetBlue doesn't have any partnerships. So I go ahead and do that. Book a flight for $300 with American for the next am and go to baggage drop area to collect my bag I had checked in earlier. There I was told I could get vouchers toward the hotel dinner etc. I collect my bag and am told by the agent there that since I cancelled my flight with JetBlue it is not in their hands any more and they can't compensate hotel etc. She did offer me a $12 voucher to use toward snacks at the airport. All in all this episode cost me an extra $400 (extra hotel cabs new ticket). I understand mechanical failures happen. I travel a lot all of the world. I was surprised how little these agents at the gate knew about how to handle people when their company is obviously letting them down. A dull blank emotionless stare and the customers had to suggest alternate satisfactory solutions. No proactive support.,,,,,,4,1,1,4,,,1,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,A Jose,Costa Rica,7/20/2014,I've flown Jetblue twice the first one was a good experience with no delays snacks beverages and nice crew. The second one was terrible: our flight JFK-FLL was at 6am and we got to the airport at 1am the screens showed that our flight was cancelled and we waited until 3.30am to receive any attention from JetBlue staff. They said that we would need to wait until tomorrow for another flight or we would need to go to LaGuardia Airport to take another flight in 2 hours offered no accommodation transportation to LGA or vouchers. We had to take a taxi from JFK to LGA. Fortunately we got our flight on time from LGA to FLL but we are really disappointed with this drawback. I think this is the last time we will fly Jetblue.,,,,,5,4,2,2,3,,,4,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Frank McPhillips,United States,7/6/2014,My son boarded a JetBlue flight in SF at 5.59am on July 2 bound for Portland ME connecting at JFK in NYC. The flight was diverted to Rochester N.Y where it sat for 8 hours. A JB agent in Rochester changed his connecting flight to Portland without checking to see if his connecting flight was on time (in fact it too was delayed). When he finally arrived at JFK at 11.30am he found that the new connecting flight on which he was re-routed had been cancelled. His original connecting flight however was the scheduled to depart JFK at 2.30 am. Ultimately his original connecting flight was also cancelled. The JB customer assistance desk was completely vacant and there were hour-long waits on the phone. A single gate agent was attempting to assist and her line was 100 feet long. When he reached her she said his only option was a flight leaving at 10.30 pm on July 3. He finally obtained a seat on a flight to Boston departing at 11 am. Eight hours later he walked past a gate at JFK that showed a flight to Portland at 1.30 pm which was never mentioned by the gate agent the previous night. He managed to get on the flight. All in all the worst nightmare air travel story I've ever heard. Never fly on JetBlue.,,,,,,0,1,0,0,,,0,0

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,D Mauro,United States,7/3/2014,JFK-POS. Unfortunately Jetblue has lost its edge and is now very similar to the other U.S. carriers.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,S Morris,United States,6/9/2014,Used to love JetBlue but my last trip a couple of days ago changed my perception. The plane seemed to be old and in a poor condition. Basically none of the“creature comforts” worked. We had 2 seats. The seat back on the 1st seat was broken and would not stay in the upright position. The video screen on the 2nd seat worked but the screen itself would not stay put. The reading lights did not work on either of the seats significant on a late-night flight. The plug for the audio on the 1st seat only worked occasionally. There were plenty of open rows of seats but they all required us to pay extra so we could not be moved to those seats. Otherwise our only option was to move from an aisle and middle seat to a window and middle seat. It was a long flight (JFK to SFO) and we get up and walk around every hour or so and just did not want to impose on another (probably sleeping) passenger that frequently so declined this option. Bottom line is that while the legroom was great and the people were friendly the seats were uncomfortable and plane appeared to be old and in disrepair. Certainly not worth the extra money that we used to be willing to pay to be a passenger on a JetBlue plane rather than on a competitors plane.,,,,,3,2,4,4,3,,,2,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,L Southworth,United States,6/5/2014,BOS to SAN and SEA to BOS. This is by far my favorite domestic (US based) airline and I preferentially fly them whenever I can. They really do go the extra mile to make sure your flight is pleasant - start to finish.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Patricia Tice,United States,5/23/2014,My flight was cancelled to NYC where I was supposed to have a 3 hour lay-over before catching an international flight to London. 2 hours before flight time JetBlue cancelled my flight and rebooked me on a flight the next day. I spent over 1 hour on the phone with them mainly on hold while they were supposed to figure out how I could get from Rochester NY down to JFK in time for my flight. After over an hour's wait a supervisor got back to me and said - sorry nothing we can do - flight is canceled due to weather. I asked where was the weather problem. As she was saying that there is a lot of rain in NYC I was looking at the weather.com report that reported partly sunny skies at JFK. Because of the weather excuse I cannot get compensation from my travel insurance. I have lost a day of vacation will be late for a family wedding and have had to pay a hefty fee to rebook my flight overseas. Thanks a lot Jet Blue.,,,,,1,5,1,0,0,,,1,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Edwin Hansen,South Africa,5/17/2014,I have not even boarded the plane yet and am already not happy with the airline. Tavelling as a couple I tried to do an online checkin to secure seats next to each other. Online checkin not available. Please see the agent at the airport. I went to Seattle airport 10 hours before the flight to ensure that we could get adjacent seats and was assured by agent at the check in counter we were sitting next to each other. After receiving our boarding passes I noticed that we were in different rows and brought this to the agents attention. Suddenly the only way to get adjacent seats were to upgrade or check at the gate. At the gate it was the same story: Yes we can get you adjacent seats for a small fee of $80 per person. What a scam.

Canceled flight cost us money in the end because we got sent to a different airport and had to get a car service to our original airport to get back to our own car.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,A Taylor,United States,4/28/2014,It seems as though their customer service and on-time flight performance has gone down tremendously. My sister and I purchased two one-way tickets from San Juan PR to JFK. We were told by the personnel at the gate that our flight was being delayed approximately 4 hrs due to a plane in New York with mechanical problems. Simultaneously we began receiving emails from the jetblue website telling us the delayed flight would depart at an earlier time. The Gate personnel had no knowledge of this. Bottom line is: customers pay hefty fares for some flights particularly on weekends and we do expect these planes to leave on time.

At first I was so satisfied with the service that I have never flown with any other airline. But lately the past year especially the service has gone downhill. The staff used to be so friendly and always smiling. My last Flight was in December my TV was not working when I informed the flight attendant I got nothing but attitude and her answer was ""I don't know what to tell you."" After six years of using them that was my last and final time.",,,,,3,5,1,5,2,,,2,0

Lauderdale. The customer service representatives kept passengers well informed they ordered pizza for passengers gave out free water and snacks and were happy to offer assistance to passengers who wanted to change their flights. We had free inflight movies and also when we arrived at our destination we received an e-mail stating that we were given a voucher for future flights for our inconvenience caused by the delay.,,,,,10,4,5,4,5,,,4,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,C Klewicki,United States,3/31/2014,"Newark NJ to Ft Lauderdale FL on the way to Costa Rica March 30th. Transfer flight was cancelled after a few delays. Instead of rushing to find people ways of getting to their destination staff promptly resorted to ""save face"" mode claiming it was not the fault of the airline. On top of that false claim they refused to help reschedule a flight if it involved a different airline. Therefore our party of 3 will have to pay extra to get a decent company to help us reach our destination. Last time I deal with this airline.",,,Economy,,1,3,1,3,2,,,1,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,N Tepper,United States,3/6/2014,I have always flown JetBlue and have had only positive experiences with them. Their flights are always on time. The seats are comfortable and clean. The TV is free. The bag check is free. The snacks are free. When my TV didn't work they gave me free cocktails for the rest of the plane ride to keep me entertained. I've used them flying mostly from JFK to LA and from JFK to Florida and have never had an issue so I'm sure that those with negative experiences unfortunately were just dealing with flukes!,,,,,10,4,4,5,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,D Citoyen,United States,2/27/2014,I flew with JetBlue for the first time when I missed my original flight in JFK and I was checked in for their JFK-Phoenix service. They have nice and new planes with more leg room. My ticket was originally with British Airways and they did a great co-operation with British Airways with booking me for the last minute flights and sending my untagged baggage all the way from Italy to Phoenix. Plus they have very friendly staff I'm very satisfied.,,,,,10,5,5,4,4,,,5,1

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Scott Semple,United States,2/7/2014,I booked a flight 1/4/14 to Orlando from Hartford. I was willing to pay a premium to include extra leg room due to a non-stop flight option and pay $600. My flight was 7pm out of Hartford and expected to arrive in Orlando at 10pm. A snow storm is approaching later tonight 6-8hrs after take-off. It's now 10pm stars are in the sky and I should have already been in Orlando. I was told that the direct flight was cancelled at 6pm as I arrived at the JetBlue desk. I received no email or text message. I asked Jet Blue for other alternative options and they could not even come close to accommodate until next day? Very premature to cancel a non-stop flight. They have lost a customer. As a result I had to cancel my trip and drove home.,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,0,0

They had to reset the system but it didn't help. The seats available to move to were not offered because they were extra room seats. It made for a long trip.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,R Thomas-Reilly,United Kingdom,1/20/2014,"My flight like the flights of thousands of others was cancelled when JetBlue grounded all aircraft from NYC and Boston on 6th January. Fine I can understand and accept that extraordinary measures must be taken in extraordinary times. The real shock unfurled when I was to encounter the 'customer service' team at JFK airport (and I use this term very lightly). After queuing for 4 hours we were all greeted by unhelpful and at some points outwardly aggressive staff. My fellow passenger was told that he could not be re-booked for 3 days. When he pointed this out the 'customer service' agent's reply was ""very good I can see you can count - not my problem"". I was grounded for 4 days and was only informed of the option of a hotel when I did some detective work with fellow passengers. As I was flying due to a death in the family I ended-up taking a 13 hour bus trip to Toronto where WestJet went out of their way to accommodate me. In the end JetBlue's attempt at compensation was a $50 credit to fly on one of their flights in the future.",,,,,,0,1,0,0,,,1,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,S Goldsmith,United States,1/10/2014,Flight 449 from Boston Logan airport to Orlando scheduled to depart on Jan 6 at 11.30. My first (and last) experiece with JetBlue was horrendous. This airline managed to cause us 7+ hours of delay with no explanation or compensation. We were pushed from gate to gate three times then when we finally got a plane we had no crew then no pilot! Then there were maitenance issues. The part that baffles me is that there was no reason for the initial delay! In theory when you book a flight there is supposed to be a plane available as well as a crew and pilot. I have no idea how this was cause for delay aside from total imcompetance which was made up for by nothing except an announcement that there would be no running water on the flight. In the future I will do myself a service by booking elsewhere even at the expence of a few extra dollars.,,,,,,0,0,0,0,,,2,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Calabro Danilo,Italy,1/9/2014,FLL-JFK on Jan 6th 2014. Flight scheduled at 7.13 am arrived as FLL Jetblue Terminal at 6am as we had luggage to check-in. The terminal was packed but check-in worked fine. At 7am we were informed by the display at the gate that the flight was delayed 1 hour therefore departing at 8.13am. At 8.30am still no news and no aircraft. At 9am our aircraft shows up at the gate and the announcement said that in a matter of few minutes time to clean up the aircraft boarding would have started. At 9.30 informed that there's no captain to fly the aircraft. At 10.30 a captain shows up. Boarding in 15 minutes is announced once again. At 11am our captain walks out of the aircraft. At 11.30 announcement says that a new captain was on his way. At 11.45 the newly found captain shows up. At 12.00 boarding actually starts and we finally took off at 12.30 with 5 hours + 17 minutes delay. During the flight the pilot explained that jetblue had a major operation challenges that morning.,,,,,1,4,2,4,4,,,1,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,T Kahn,United States,1/8/2014,Terrible experience on Sunday January 5 2014 at JFK. They cancelled the flight on which we were booked a little over an hour before take off. There was chaos in the airport due to the number of flights JetBlue cancelled at once and its unwillingness to assist the customers to find replacement flights. They kept announcing over the loud speakers that they had no replacement availability for several days and that customers should not even try to rebook with JetBlue's airport personnel. That is extremely inconvenient once one is at the airport with luggage. We ended up buying new tickets on a JetBlue flight 6 hrs later but that flight after being delayed 3 or 4 times was also cancelled - due to there not being a pilot or co-pilot available! That was 6 hrs after the scheduled departure time! We found a JetBlue flight that had a few unoccupied seats and a sympathetic agent got clearance to allow us to swap our second ticket for that flight. That one agent was the only helpful person we encountered at Jet Blue. We still do not have our luggage which was set ticketed for the cancelled flight. There was no time to retrieve it and still board the alternative flight we identified.,,,,,,4,1,3,1,,,2,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,K Hyde,United States,1/8/2014,We flew on January 5th had to connect through Boston which was effected by the winter storm. Our flight was supposed to leave at 6am but after an hour JetBlue said that it was still trying to locate one flight attendant. After only minimal updates at 11am they were able to take off however JetBlue never provided any information on how it would handle connecting flights. When you asked you received a different answer each time from a different airport personnel. When the flight landed at Boston there were no personnel to assist those that missed connections there was no communication from the flight deck on missed connections and each counter agent in Boston was dismissive. Very disorganized not helpful a free-for-all environment left it up to you to find your way home.,,,,,,4,1,3,3,,,1,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,G Sean,United States,12/29/2013,JFK-FLL-JFK. The flight was extremely inexpensive. Flight left 20 minutes late but landed on time. Even More Space Seat was worth the cost to avoid the TSA line at JFK alone but the room onboard was great. The flight was smooth but the audio jack was overused and my headset plug was constantly falling out if I moved the wrong way. Return flight was not as smooth the gate changed 6 times at FLL and was very confusing. IFE was not working at my seat but was given a $15 voucher for future flight although it expires within the year. Flight was also moderately turbulent with no feedback from the flight crew. Flight back was not in Even More Space but was still roomy enough for a big guy like me. JetBlue isn't perfect but much better than most that fly out of the area.,,,,,7,4,4,4,2,,,5,1

Because of this we missed our connection from PHIL to SEA and I am stuck in PHIL. Called JetBlue and asked them to accommodate us with another flight from PHIL to SEA today and they wont do it. Asked them to at least pay for the lodging tonight because we stuck in PHIL and they wont do it. On a brighter note Alaska are willing to put us in a flight back today for free!,,,,,,3,1,3,3,,,1,0

A $15 credit only if we fly on Jet Blue again and only if we pay for another flight with them within the next year! So for our inconvenience we get to book and pay for another flight with them!

Wish they had complementary meals for the flights that are 5+ hrs long. Flew from BUF-SFO everything went smoothly on time departures. Flights from SFO-BOS BOS- JFK and JFK-BUF were delayed and they apologized for that. Customer service in BOS was good but customer service in JFK wasn't good at all.

Customer has to return to the Airport to pick up their luggage or make arrangements on their own to have it shipped - JetBlue baggage service called 7am to tell me to pick up my luggage - finally agreed to send with 3rd party service for cash fee $30 - It arrived after 4 pm so I attended my business meetings in dirty travel clothing - JetBlue has got to figure out a better way - I would rather pay upfront for luggage service than get free and no respect.,,,Economy,,4,3,1,3,2,,,3,0

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,H Maxwell,United Kingdom,11/14/2013,JFK to LAX very good flight first time flying with Jet Blue very nice flight. Leg room is good and crew were professional offering prompt service and the captain explaining weather and how long he expected turbulence to last etc. The only negative on the flight was being a vegetarian there was only the quinoa salad available for a meal and by the time they got to our row (16) they had run out as there were apparently only 7 or 8 salads. They handled it very well were really polite and gave me a snack box free of charge but I think I should be able to order a proper meal on a 6 hour flight. The return flight was not as good staff were a bit indifferent we were delayed 1.5 hours with no explanation or apology and it took 40 mins for the first bag to arrive in the baggage claim area.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,F Carson,United States,10/9/2013,"I flew JetBlue 26 times in a 3 month time span going from DCA to BOS. It is a great airline and a pleasure to fly. The best is the legroom the nice flight attendants and the in flight entertainment. On about 1/4th of my trips had heavy delays but that's because of weather and was unavoidable. I had only one really bad flight that was delayed for about 4 hours but that was the worst of it. There are no ""middle seats"" as the configuration is 2 and 2 and there are no carts - the flight attendants use baskets of chips and put the soft drinks in the pockets of their apron. I like that. Then there is the in-flight entertainment which makes the flight seem a lot shorter and pleasant. I notice that the fares are usually competitive with American or Delta (or in some cases a little more) but its worth it in my opinion.",,,,,10,5,5,5,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,S Harrison,United States,10/3/2013,We traveled between July and September 2013. My friend travels with a portable kidney machine. I notified them of this fact when I made the reservation by computer. I was told he could bring the machine and another medical bag for free. When it was time to board the plane they took everybody  except the disabled persons first including children in strollers. I think a person with a kidney machine should trump a child with a stroller for boarding. When we got onto the plane I asked one on the flight attendants where we could store this somewhat heavy kidney machine. She promptly told us there was no room to store it other than the overhead bin. I told her I couldn't lift this machine over my head. Another flight attendant and the disabled person lifted it into the overhead. On the return trip we just decided to check it in. The woman at the check-in desk was very accommodating.,,,,,7,4,3,4,0,,,4,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Lee Phyllis,United States,9/29/2013,I took JetBlue twice within the last 10 days. The first from Chicago to Boston the plane left more than an hour late than scheduled due to machinery problems and midway during the flight it was revealed to us that we were landing in Buffalo NY because the problems apparently had not been fixed. I ended up getting home more than 5 hours later than scheduled that night. I was issued a travel bank credit so I used this to take another JetBlue flight from LA to Boston a few days later thinking that the same thing probably cannot happen again. Apparently I was wrong. The flight was late again for another hour due to machinery problems. While we were waiting on the tarmac I asked my husband to ask for a blanket as it felt a bit cold and the flight attendant wanted to charge us $5 for the blanket. I can't help but think that: you've wasted a total of 5-10 hours of our time in the past few days and you're asking us for $5? This is the last time I will take JetBlue unless they are significantly cheaper or have a much more convenient time than other options (Which I don't think they do).,,,,,2,3,1,1,3,,,2,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Imelda Dy-An,United States,9/25/2013,Very disappointed with the 5-6 hrs delay of arrival in Puerto Rico from LAX on 9/14/13. We flew in a day early of our embarkation for our 7 days Caribbean cruise and had our travel agent book us at the Sheraton San Juan so we could tour the place on the day of arrival on 9/14/13. Our flight was delayed due to radio problems after we left JFK on a connecting flight to San Juan. We got diverted to Orlando Fla for refuelling and to have the problem fixed but heard that the radio problem was not fixed. The plans we made were spoiled by this. We arrived at the hotel quite late in afternoon. Due to embarkation for our cruise the next day (9/15) it gave us limited time to do the activities we wanted.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,M Xing,United States,9/13/2013,"JFK-CLT. I've flown them often and the only complaint I can muster is their occasional delays. The attendants were friendly as usual. The free inflight Live DirectTV and Radio is better than most international airlines and I believe 36 in of legroom come standard (though I may be wrong). Free (""unlimited"") snacks and beverages are a nice addition considering it's only a 2 hour flight. Their custom built Terminal 5 at JFK is excellent - fast WiFi tons of power ports and lots of space and shops. It makes the occasional delay quite bearable. Leather seats are great and you can even purchase ""Even More Legroom"" which being quite short I've never needed to but the purchase also let's you use first class check in and security lines along with priority boarding. The free checked bag is amazingly useful especially if you're connecting flight is international.

When I asked if the movie would start over if I bought a head seat she looked at me like I was stupid and said no. The other flight attendant that was with her glared at me and looked at my seat number like I was going to cause problems for them when my friend asked what was the point of handing out the headsets after the movie already started.

I haven't been on a flight of theirs that actually took off at its scheduled departure in the past year or so. There are constant delays with the excuse that it's due to ""weather"" issues when I know there are no bad weather patterns from where I am to where I'm going. They use it as an excuse so that they don't have to pay the customers any money for retribution. Then once on my flight they are in a hurry to only offer the limited free menu items. We are not offered any drinks or complimentary snacks besides peanuts and soda. Flight attendants are also in a rush for people to get off their cell phones and become rude. This past flight they did just that and then we continued to sit on the runway for an additional half an hour during which time I used my cell phone because we weren't going anywhere.

Upon explaining to her that I had it on airplane mode and that it posed no threat to the in-flight navigation system she offered another sarcastic response. After the continued verbal confrontation I was left wondering if there was a way she could have gone about this without embarrassing myself and my family.",,,,,3,3,1,2,0,,,3,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Waheed Malik,United States,7/30/2013,JFK to ORD. Flight was full and staff at the gate were irritated and unhelpful. Seated in 21B and my wife seated in 13F. Tried to get seat next to each other gate staff refused. They were also unorganized. We were on time at the Airport but they delayed the flight 20 minutes and then they started boarding. Boarding was fine but no help. Ground staff at the gate very rude booking staff helpful but Inflight staff not helpful at all. Flight taxied for about an hour before departing JFK. They definitely need competent staff and need training in Customer Service.,,,,,,3,2,3,0,,,2,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,M Morse,United States,7/29/2013,Flying Portland to Long beach flight was supposed to board an hour and thirteen minutes ago. No indication of when we will leave. Reading reviews online and realizing this is a common occurrence with this airline. This is my first try at saving a few dollars by flying JetBlue. I'd be hard pressed to fly with them again given this experience and their poor track record (at least as reported by online reviewers). For the good of all JetBlue should charge more fix their planes and their processes.,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,,,2,0

When the plane was in the air my wife asked to be seated in the more legroom seat she could sleep more comfortably and the request was denied.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,A Chan,United States,7/7/2013,Flights between Portland and Anaheim were a huge disappointment in terms of flight delays. We saw the airplane arrive but our flight kept being delayed without giving us a reason. We understand that there are some issues going on but as customers we would like to be recognized for our waiting at the airport. The good sides: The flight seats were okay. The drinks and snacks were pretty nice. But I have had better experiences on other flights.,,,,,6,4,4,4,3,,,3,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Mark Krampen,United States,7/4/2013,Flight 2402 from JFK to Buffalo on July 2 2013 was delayed 6 times. Felt sorry for the staff member working the gate as many passengers were complaining to her. Should have been a top official from JetBlue fielding the complaints. My wife and I had just got off a 10+ hour flight from Istanbul to New York and JetBlue was our connecting flight to Buffalo. All we wanted to do is get home. Six delays and no JetBlue higher up there to explain why there were delays. If I never fly JetBlue again.,,,,,3,2,4,3,3,,,2,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,H Davis,United States,7/1/2013,From Boston into Philadelphia. Flight down delayed 3 times due to what was reported as bad weather in Philadelphia. Waiting around in the airport for that long was exhausting. I found out the last delay was that the crew had timed out during the time of the delays. On the flight back from Philadelphia to Boston the flight was delayed only once. Overall the flight was pleasant and the crew friendly. When I have a lot of free time on my hands won't mind flying with this airline again.,,,,,5,4,4,4,4,,,3,1

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,C Cooper,United States,5/20/2013,Excellent starting with the telephone customer service representative who set up our seating and arranged for an aisle chair. This is one of the only times we arrived at the airport and the aisle chair was waiting instead of having to remind an employee to get it after prior arrangements were made. This is the first trip that I did not come home with mysterious bruises from being bumped around getting on and off the plane. Bad weather resulted in the plane being directed to Orlando instead of Ft Lauderdale. The staff arranged to help me off the plane even suggested I leave due to the projected wait time even though it was more work for them. The were pleasant and friendly even though they must have been very tired and stressed by the delays.,,,Economy,,10,5,5,4,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Atluri Ashok,India,5/20/2013,I have taken 4 flights with jetBlue during 2nd week of May. My experience was very pleasant from the time of checking in. I had 2 pieces of luggage and everything was done very swiftly and efficiently. The leg space is very comfortable which is much more than most of the airlines I travelled. Flights are neat and the cabin crew were courteous and efficient. Inflight service of complimentary drinks and snacks were served to every one enthusiastically. The in house entertainment was great with many channels to view. The entertainment is no way less than many international flights. The luggage came very fast at the carrousels for all the flights that I took. I had a very pleasant experience in all the flights. I will be happy if they can waive the $100/ penalty for the change of flights.,,,,,10,5,5,5,5,,,4,1

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,L Gordon,United States,5/10/2013,Jet Blue is the largest carrier out of my home airport Boston. Consequently I end up flying them quite a lot. So far in 2013 I have not had a single on time departure. When one gets delayed over an hour in each direction on a day trip to Washington DC its difficult to have positive feelings. I am not wowed that they pass out free snacks since there is not one healthy choice in the basket I just want to get where I am going. To me Jet Blue is Jet Late.,,,,,1,4,4,1,5,,,3,0

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,E Hyland,United States,3/22/2013,I just got back from the Port Charlotte FL area using the Sarasota airport. I had non-stop flights both ways and enjoyed the trip. I was impressed with the process of ordering drinks whereby the Flight Crew came around and wrote down orders. I found this very efficient rather than blocking the aisle with a cart. Also they provided you with a full can of soda vs. other airlines that ration you by pouring 2 glasses out of a can. The snacks were also enjoyable as you were able to choose your preference. The free TV was a plus too.,,,,,10,5,5,5,0,,,5,1

Very good legroom comfortable seats and the best entertainment I've seen - they offered live TV. Flights landed ahead schedule both on outbound and inbound (45 min ahead schedule inbound).

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Theresa B DeFluri,United States,2/4/2013,Very disappointed. I paid over $300 for 2 seats for a round trip to Massachusetts (an hours flight). I booked the flight 2 weeks prior to my departure date. In order to sit next to my 13 year old daughter I had to pay $30 extra just to have 'leg room' and be seated next to one another. Planes are supposed to be ergonomically designed to carry passengers. Passengers have legs. Why do you deem it necessary to charge extra for appropriate leg space? Why not offer better food items and charge for that? That is something people might want to pay for but can do with out if necessary esp on a short flight. Proper leg room and sitting beside your own children should be a priority on your airline and not one that you must pay extra fees for.,,,,,4,4,4,3,4,,,2,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,P Kamaev,United States,1/17/2013,On January 7 my wife myself and our 1-year old son were flying from Fort Myers to Boston on 4.35 pm flight #462. Flight was delayed twice. By that time we were all exhausted. Our new estimated time of arrival to Boston would be around 1 am so we decided to reschedule our flight to the next morning. Nobody from Jet Blue offered any kind of compensation or help with a hotel. Next morning the flight was delayed once again! Maintenance problems were cited again as a reason. It is very sad to see how badly maintained this airline has become and that we will have to choose another carrier next time.,,,,,,3,2,3,3,,,1,0

Unfortunately our flight to San Diego was delayed a short time but we had worse news to come when we had boarded and were ready to leave. Told we would have to change planes and were taken off to a different gate. In all we were delayed by approx 2 hours. Once we actually took off our flight was made very comfortable and enjoyable by the cabin crew. Despite being in the back row of seats next to the toilets we were impressed by our leg room. I would use this airline again.,,,,,9,4,5,4,4,,,4,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,K D Natarajan,Australia,1/14/2013,Las Vegas to JFK JFK to Buffalo (travelling with 2 young children) - Sep 29 1.54pm flight no 194. Flight delayed due to tech problem and cancelled for the same reason - was in the short queue for 3 to 4 hrs (very inefficient staff) to make alternative arrangements. Finally got boarding pass for flight at 10.30 pm on the same day and they issued voucher for a short stay in a hotel in Las Vegas - at hotel we discovered the voucher was for a taxi not for hotel stay - returned back to Las Vegas airport - complained about it in baggage check in area and waited for 10.30 flight. Return flight from Buffalo to JFK October 1 2012. Again was a problem during check in due to incorrect rescheduling done in Las Vegas airport on 29 Sep 2012.

Apparently if you select ""no preference"" as your seating option when buying your ticket you have to go to the customer service rep before boarding and have them assign you a seat. At no point in the process of purchasing the ticket or checking in and obtaining the boarding pass was I told this.

Seat was spacious. We encountered a 2.5 hour delay due to a dent found on the aircraft. I do believe they should have let passengers disembark. However IFE was switched on and snacks distributed so they managed the situation very well. The complete product in a normal situation I think is great.,,,,,8,4,4,3,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,J Trevers,United States,9/9/2012,JFK-CUN-JFK. To my great surprise the TV and satellite radio were actually working throughout both flights. Crew generally friendly. Both flights landed early. Sat in extra legroom seats where I suspect that many others had not paid but checked in without seats and were given the premium seats since that''s all that was available. On the return though I checked in online I was sent back to the ticket counter since an online boarding pass must still be stamped. And there is a $21 departure tax which most other airlines include in their ticket prices. But with Jetblue it must be paid at check-in.,,,,,8,4,4,4,5,,,4,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,N Shyshkin,Canada,9/9/2012,BUF-BOS-CLT and return. All four flights on an E-190. To Charlotte the planes were clean with nice FAs excellent working PTVs  on time flights and served with snacks and drinks. Back to Buffalo the first flight got delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy storms and I was afraid I was going to miss my flight in Boston. Although when I arrived the flight was supposed to have left but they kept it at the gate until I arrived 20 minutes later! PTV's weren't as good on the return flight was the only problem.

As a matter of fact on the return journey the FA came for a second round of snacks. Would definitely fly with them again. The only negative comments on our return flight they changed gates without notice to passengers. When we approached to one of the ground staff for this they apologized for it and said that was done because of operational reasons and they were supposed to make the announcement.,,,,,9,5,5,5,4,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,N Saylor,United States,8/28/2012,I flew out of Baltimore to Seattle. I had to make a layover in Boston. Flight from Baltimore to Boston was relaxing and stress free. The free DIRECTV was a great bonus. The only con that I do have is that the seat that I was in made a very annoying sound whenever I tried to recline. Flight from Boston to Seattle was also stress free even though it was a red eye. On the long flight home I bought myself a BEEF UP box and it was good. With the free DIRECTV and a full stomach on the long flight home it was relaxing.,,,,,9,4,4,4,5,,,5,1

They delayed the flight and then cancelled it all together but not until he sat in the airport for 5 hours being promised that it would take off. It was not until the crew got in and they determined that they were overtime that they cancelled the flight. They should have known their hours way before then. My feeling is that they kept them hanging on so that they did not have to book anyone with other airlines. What's worse is that I used credits from jetBlue because they did the same thing to us last year.,,,,,5,4,4,3,3,,,2,0

Later on we find out that only JetBlue had cancelled all their flights to FLL Airport and we were stuck in Syracuse. There were no ""weather issues"" and it seems that JetBlue is known for using this excuse in order not to pay or credit their customers. We didn't leave on Sunday July 15th instead JetBlue said that the only available flight to make it to Florida was on Monday July 16th from Syracuse NY to Orlando Florida.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,S Papula,United States,7/3/2012,I was traveling with my family on a what was supposed to be a short flight (from San Francisco to Long beach). After everyone boarded the flight captain announced that navigation system was broken. He said it will take 15 to 20 min to fix it. After 2.5 hours problem is not fixed. We were still on the flight they didn't even let us wait at the gate. After 5 hours they provided the option to get on other flight after 5 hours. But we had to go to the ticketing counter to collect the luggage. So we missed new flight plus the old flight (which got fixed). After 6.30 hours we are still in airport. At that point I had to call it quits and buy tickets from another airline.

Upon arrival at Terminal 5 I noticed the majority of the flights were delayed and my flight was delayed 3 separate times. I could have looked for other options but was not provided with this option. The desk said we would be compensated for the mechanical delay.

Flight delayed during takeoff at JFK due to unspecified VIPs although this seemed to be more the Airport than JetBlue's issue. Communication regarding delay sporadic. On positive ledger Free bag check in meant ample space for carry on luggage and IFE combined with small snacks being brought round a big step up from more 'Famous' carriers.

After we got to the check-in counter they said they were sorry and couldn't get us another flight and that many others who were going to our cruise couldn't make it either because the airport in Florida was closed. We knew this was untrue because our other family from another city had a flight to Florida the same time we did and they were able to check in and everything. After about 30 minutes of trying to negotiate with them we decided to get a refund. Being disappointed we called in to the cruise company and told them about our situation the next day. The cruise company said that JetBlue told us to wait for them to book another flight but we went home instead. I find it completely ridiculous that they had nerves to lie to us.,,,,,2,0,3,0,0,,,0,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Erin Sanchez,United States,6/18/2012,This was the first time traveling on JetBlue. It was awesome! We took the red eye from PDF to JFK and the first surprise was how quickly the staff got us boarded and on our way. There was no waiting for people to stow their bags. There was a quick check on cell phones and seatbelts but they were so no nonsense about it that it was refreshing! The biggest surprises were that they offer TV for all passengers and it's good TV! They offer food! And the best was the lack of the service cart! How wonderful it was to not have to compete with the cart or time your bathroom trips so as to avoid getting stuck behind the cart. The staff was extremely efficient about helping passengers without being overwhelming. Even when they had to make announcements it was quick concise and non intrusive. We will definitely fly this airline again! Great experience!,,,,,10,4,5,4,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,A Hahn,United States,6/6/2012,My family and I flew from Newark NJ to Fort Lauderdale FL return. Checking-in and boarding the flight to FLL went very smooth - in fact smoother than my previous flight with United Airlines. Onboard the flight in both directions the seats in the standard section were comfortable and of course we had the free DirectTV service. You also had free access to certain SiriusXM stations as well. The service overall onboard was good giving us good complimentary drinks and snacks. Checking-in and boarding the flight to EWR was smooth even though there was 15-minute delay due to a deluge at the airport. The only consequence is that if you don't bring your headset you would have to pay for your own which is $2. Before they used to give them away for free but now they're charging for it.,,,,,9,4,4,5,5,,,4,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Jennifer DiSanti,United States,5/21/2012,Last year my family and I took a trip to NY on Jet Blue for the first time. I was very impressed and happy with my experience. The onboard entertainment kept my children happy and busy. The flight crew was extremely friendly and glad to accommodate us. The ride was smooth and the pilot gave timely updates on the flight status and arrival to our destination. I booked a trip to the Bahamas and chose them once again.,,,,,9,5,5,4,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,R D Kivett,United Kingdom,5/21/2012,JFK-RDU: First time flying this carrier. They have a nice terminal in JFK but the security line takes a long time to get through took 40min. Staff were very friendly and kept you abreast of the flight situation even when everything was going fine. Takes a long time to taxi at JFK with all of the flights but this is not airline's fault. Seat space was excellent for both the ER190 going out and the A320 return. Didn't use the inflight entertainment as the flight was only an hour so no need to. The giving out of free snacks and drinks is nice along with the free first checked bag. I will definitely use them again.,,,,,9,5,5,4,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,P Lucey,United Kingdom,5/20/2012,All round good airline and nice flight. The service was great from Bogota (Colombia) to Orlando. The Orlando crew were lovely. Great service. Very happy staff. Seat space was good. We were offered snacks and refreshments for free and had TV too (eat before or between connecting flights is best which I knew in advance so snacks were good). Only 3 movies to select from but lots of TV stations so it worked well for me. Service on the ground was excellent in Colombia. I was really happy with the flight price and the service and seat space.,,,,,9,5,5,4,3,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,J Min,South Korea,4/9/2012,JFK-FLL roundtrip. FLL bound on E190. Spacious leg and shoulder room! Direct TV had many channels. FA's were very friendly and helpful. Return flight to JFK was totally different. FA's were unhappy and unenthusiastic. They looked tired and just wanting to get home. Older A320 still had plenty of space but not as nice as smaller E190. My rating is average of two different flight experiences.,,,,,7,5,4,4,5,,,4,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,H McDonald,United States,4/3/2012,ORD-BOS-SJU return. Check-in staff and FA's really helpful. Served food and drinks (one of the few American carriers that do that). Live TV was good although you loose reception on international routes but that's ok as they give you free movies. Would recommend them over all other domestic carriers.,,,Economy,,9,5,5,4,4,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,S Symon,United States,3/22/2012,BWI-BOS-BWI on E190 and the service could not have been better.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Amanda Siegel,United States,3/1/2012,Round trip from Orlando to the Bahamas. Both flights were great. The crew on each flight were extremely nice and caring. The flight back delayed one hour but they were extremely apologetic and efficient. Even though the flights were short they still provided drinks and snacks. On the flight back we had a bit of turbulence but the captain kept us informed of everything. A plus is the individual TV's in every seat.,,,,,9,5,5,4,5,,,4,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,S Agre,United States,2/24/2012,Cabin crew friendly and helpful flight was 2 hours and snacks given out for free as well as drinks. TVs were nice. Flight was well priced seats were comfortable and I had plenty of legroom.,,,,,8,5,4,5,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Dmitry Kuzin,Russian Federation,2/17/2012,"Non-stop red-eye flight A320 JFK to Las Vegas. Price was the most important thing for us when we booked. At check-in I asked for a window seat and they gave us two ""Even More"" legroom seats near the window though we paid no extra fees. Captain was friendly before departure. Helpful flight attendants but can't say they showed any extra care. Cabin was clean and comfortable. A/C was working at the max and it was really cold by the end of the flight so some people had to buy blankets for $7. Flight on time baggage ok upon arrival.",,,,,8,5,4,3,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,G Preis,United States,2/11/2012,NY to Ft. Lauderdale. My last minute ticket was not the inexpensive ticket I usually expect from jetBlue.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,T May,United States,1/20/2012,OAK-IAD. Best flight arrangement to the East Coast even though I had to sit next to a screaming baby on a red-eye flight. Firstly the IFE was top notch. The seats were comfortable and they gave out night-gear. Finally at less than 5 hours it was the shortest flight as well. Staff were helpful and the food decent.,,,,,9,5,5,4,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,N Friedrich,United States,1/12/2012,Roundtrip Oakland to Long Beach check in using kiosks was a breeze. The staff were professional friendly and welcoming. The inflight experience for the value of tickets is unbeatable. Inflight entertainment with free DirecTV and XM radio on each seatback. The free quality snacks and beverages delicious.,,,Economy,,9,4,5,4,5,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,J Sabaduquia,United States,12/21/2011,JFK-BTV. JFK T5 was clean with lots of shops free WiFi and security was a breeze. It was on a newly painted A320 however the cabin was the older type. Seats were comfortable legroom was excellent and the cabin was showing its age but well maintained. Flight time was only 45 minutes but drinks were served as well as peanuts and cookies. Service was rushed the head FA was friendly but the other two were reserved. Live TV worked fine. Overall decent flight but nothing spectacular.,,,,,7,5,3,4,4,,,5,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,G Hally,United States,11/11/2011,FLL to LGA. Attendants simply don't care anymore. After years of only flying JetBlue and being more than satisfied it is time to try South West I think. We don't fly often a couple times a year so stark difference in airline service attitude etc readily apparent.,,,,,5,3,2,2,4,,,3,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,C Kim,United States,10/27/2011,Red eye flight from Long Beach to New York JFK with a connection in Salt Lake City. Aircraft was spacious clean and well maintained. Enjoyed the Direct TV and complimentary snacks. A drawback were the leather seats that made for uncomfortable seating for sleep as I kept sliding downwards but was manageable nonetheless.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,4,4,,,5,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,John Wagner,United States,10/21/2011,PDX-JFK in Economy (extra legroom). This was my first Jetblue flight - it felt like a flying bus. Somehow I was expecting a little more from this airline. Service was very efficient and rushed - I far prefer the friendliness of Southwest Airlines. I would use this airline again but it would not be a first choice.,,,,,8,,,,,,,,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,J Milonas,Australia,10/4/2011,NYC-LAX. We flew with a family of 4 and were assisted at every level. Legroom is very good sure the cabin livery is bland and the seats look dated but the TV options snacks and complimentary drinks outweigh any other domestic US experience we have had.,,,,,8,,,,,,,,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,J Killen,Ireland,9/21/2011,BOS-DCA-BOS. These flights were sold by Aer Lingus as part of a round-trip between Dublin and DCA. On the outward trip I received an upgrade to Extra Legroom (Row 1) on the return I was seated in Row 2 with the admonition that I would be bumped if a mobility impaired passenger needed the seat. The outbound trip was delayed due to weather conditions and I felt that more information could have been given at the gate as the departure time slipped back the return trip was early. All employees I encountered were pleasant and helpful and I was impressed a free snack/beverage was offered on these short flights.,,,,,9,,,,,,,,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,L Gordon,United States,9/17/2011,My last 3 flights with them were delayed for at least 2 hours. One trip from DCA to Boston was delayed 3 hours while we sat on the tarmac waiting for the plane to be de-iced. Every other airline was taking off and landing. Jet Blue told us that we had to wait for the de-icing truck because it wasn't being used that night by the other airlines but they had a higher safety standard. They had an inexperienced pilot and that kept us grounded for an extra 3 hours. I agree that the seats are comfortable but being held for hours to compensate for untrained staff is torture.,,,Economy,,2,,,,,,,,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,G Van Houten,United States,9/15/2011,FLL-EWR roundtrip 4-5 times each year. As jetBlue and Continental/United are the only airlines that fly direct between FLL and EWR choice is limited. I have always found the staff friendly helpful informative and quick to serve. The captain was at the front of the plane welcoming you onboard and thanking you upon arrival. The ERJ- 90s are a bit uncomfortable and narrow but the A320s are modern and clean. Always pay the $25 for extra leg room.,,,,,10,,,,,,,,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,B Lally,United States,9/15/2011,I recently flew Boston to Tampa. The flight experience was great spacious seats professional flight crew and TV screens in all the seats made the flight more enjoyable. The only negative aspect was the price of the headsets they should be complimentary for passengers. Costs could be decreased onboard the flights snacks should be made readily available throughout the flight.,,,,,8,,,,,,,,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,A Richards,United Kingdom,9/11/2011,Flew LGB-SEA. Flight departed slightly late but arrived in Seattle ahead of time.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,A Morse,United States,9/10/2011,PHX-JFK. Everything on time overnight flight. Standard JB service. Chatty flight attendants in the back made it hard to sleep. I don't feel like the seat is that great the back support is good but I think the seat bottom is thin. Arrival into JFK early.,,,,,6,,,,,,,,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,B Davis,United States,9/10/2011,Our tickets were purchased well in advance at which time assigned seating was unavailable. We showed up at the airport to check-in and were told we could not be guaranteed our seats would be together unless we purchased the extra legroom seats which we did not want. We felt we were forced to pay the extra $40 per seat so we could sit together. We again had the same poor experience on the way home. I am extremely unhappy with this experience and feel I have been ripped off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,J Trevers,United States,9/7/2011,They now have their Even More Speed security lanes but it was useless. I got to walk right up and show my ID and boarding pass but it still took 30 mins to get through security. Crew was pleasant as usual but the pilot never said a word to us. Jetblue pilots usually stand in front and introduce themselves tell you the length of the flight weather etc. This one said nothing. Legroom is great and snacks are always appreciated. Yet for the second time in a row IFE didn't work. Half the channels didn't work along with several radio stations as well. I fear they are turning into just another US carrier.,,,,,5,,,,,,,,0
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,K Dickhudt,United States,9/1/2011,IAD-JFK. Booked as a codeshare flight with South African Airways.

Due to short flight there wasn't full drink service but everyone had bottle of water on seat when boarding. Choice of two complimentary snacks. Direct TV radios and airshow were available at any seat. Seats were comfortable with nice legroom. First bag is free on all flights.

My daughter repeatedly asked for help in arranging another flight and received none from Jet Blue personnel she found them unhelpful and rude and kept repeating they were sorry but there was nothing they could do. She was left to wander around a large metropolitan airport to arrange her own flight. Although I tried many attempts to resolve the problem JetBlue were very unresponsiveness and offered no real resolution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,0

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Rich Jenkins,United States,7/18/2011,BOS-IAD. A dreadful experience. The flight was delayed and no information on further delays although they were obvious (e.g. crew lining up at what was supposed to be the departure). Well worn seats. Once on the plane we could not depart for 1hr. They easily could have kept us at the gate. The satellite radio is mostly obscurities and a lot of programming for political conservatives and evangelical Christians. It struck me as a very cheap product although one has to pay for earphones if a passenger doesn't have their own. Indifferent flight attendants and unintelligible announcements The airline seems to be trading on its previous reputation for quirky friendly service.,,,,,2,,,,,,,1,0

Gate personnel kept us informed. We left about 1hr late but made up time and got to Vegas only 20 mins behind schedule. Sat in a row with extra legroom well worth the extra cost. Food was ok. TV great though some connection issues. Only annoying thing was everyone had to deplane in LGB even if continuing to Vegas on same aircraft. I actually had to move up a row!

We sat at our original gate and we were early. There was a flight to Austin that was delayed so they moved us to a different gate where people were confused and it took some time for us to get on the plane. It was a smooth flight. The entertainment system in front of me (TV) seemed to be unattached but still worked and there are enough channels for children and adults. The cabin crew took great care of the passengers. May I say that the landing was superb!,,,,,8,,,,,,,4,1
jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,J Trevers,United States,6/19/2011,JFK-SAN/LGB-JFK The flight to San Diego was one of the best I've been on in a long time. Legroom is great free snacks first bag free lots of TV choices and satellite radio. Crew was excellent. Very enthusiastic and seemed to be enjoying their jobs so rare these days. Bag drop is way too slow as was the baggage claim. Their new meal packs for purchase are not worth the money. On the return checkin and bag drop were better. Crew was more average. The flight was full of screaming babies. Half the TV channels didn't work and the radio broke down halfway through the flight. Jetblue is always promoting the free TV and radio but they break down frequently. And as always the crew can not do anything but file a report.,,,,,7,,,,,,,4,1

It was an evening flight so to pass the time I'm trying to read using the light from the illegible TV. Stuff happens but the flight attendants didn't seem to care no apology certainly nothing to make up for the problems.

I did not received the text message alert the night before the return flight. Luckily I checked the flight status the night before and found out all flights SJU-JFK were cancelled. Called the reservation desk and after 30mins wait an agent assisted me to rebook. Only could book a connecting flight that would take me home two days later. So I had to book with another carrier AA to return home. I understand the weather in NY was bad. But AA still operated without problems. JetBlue management took very extra cautious decision to cancel the operation on that day. It was a bad call.,,,,,4,,,,,,,4,1

At time of booking paid for extra leg room on all flights. Money well spent. Free TV channels worked flawless on all flights. Smiling and very helpful crew on all flights. jetBlue terminal in JFK clean and great to spend some time while in transit. Free WIFI throughout the terminal as in MCO. Terminal 3 in LAX is a dump and way too small for the amount of passengers handled through this terminal but T3 in LAX was the only negative aspect to a wonderful flying experience with jetBlue.

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Mark Freyton,United Kingdom,10/5/2010,Boston-Fort Lauderdale. Flown with JetBlue many times and generally happy with the service. Aircraft clean well maintained and service is consistent though basic. Extra legroom seats well worth the extra money especially now they seem to get priority boarding. One gripe is the constant allowance of excessive cabin baggage which often results in late departures while stressed cabin crew offload bags that will not fit in the lockers! Twice recently on my flights it has caused confrontation during boarding and angry passengers being very rude to the crew. If only the ground staff dealt with the issue by enforcing the rules this would not happen. Apart from that snacks ok and drink service fine.,,,,,7,,,,,,,4,1

jetblue-airways,Jetblue Airways customer review,Heather Roberstein,United States,8/22/2010,"JFK to Austin TX. I really thought the competitive advantage that Jetblue had over other airlines was the CEO vision of being a ""friendly airline"". I remember the blue chips and jokes that the crews made before take-off when Jetblue started up. That is no longer the case. An older gentleman in the front row of my flight asked for a snack while the flight attendant was taking beverage orders. She spoke to him in a very rude tone and stated that she would not serve any snacks until she was finished with the beverage service. The gentlemen had no time between flights to eat. The food was an arm length away from her but she refused. She was very rude to another woman who placed her carry on in an overhead two rows up from her seat. She made her move it one compartment over. And Jetblue what is with the manual emergency instructions - with built in televisions we have to watch a manual instruction? Jetblue will not see me back as a customer. The prices are higher than the other airlines unless they are flying you on a special.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,M Tonelli,United States,7/31/2015,"My experience took a full 2 days when it should have taken only 15 hours. My family was booked with Delta. Our route was from PSA-JFK-ORD which would be operated by a 757-200. That aircraft was broken so we were rebooked with Lufthansa on a flight that would have taken us to PSA-MUC-ORD. Our flight to Munich was supposed to take off at 1pm, we waited 5 hours until we could board. The flight to Munich was operated by Air Dolomiti, we had a 1 hour 40 minute layover and I had a window seat on the long haul flight so I was happy. The boarding process was fast. Once we had boarded one passenger decided that he wanted to get off the plane, that took an hour but the crew handed out refreshments and candy while we waited. When we took off we were 1 hour 20 minutes behind schedule and I knew that we had missed our flight. Our only hope was that it too was delayed (which it wasn't). When we arrived at MUC there were vans that would take people right to their connection from the plane. Unfortunately ORD was not among the destinations. We, after spending 5 hours in a small airport had go and spend another hour in line at the Lufthansa desk. We were booked on a flight the next day with United Airlines. The next day we went to the United check-in and everything went smoothly. After the security checkpoint we had to do three more passport checks and one more baggage check before we were in departure for the U.S. Here we waited for 1.5 hours with no seats. We still hadn't gotten our seats so when last call had begun we marched up to the gate and demanded them. On the flight we had an 80's television and some okay food, nothing special. The seats were uncomfortable and I didn't sleep one bit. We arrived on time only to find a large amount of international arrivals so the arrivals area was chaotic. In the Baggage Hall there were mountains and rows of luggage just taken off the conveyor belt just to make space for more arrivals. Then once the luggage came we had to wait for at least an hour to go through the last inspection and then we we were home free.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Brandi Porter,United States,7/29/2015,"Everytime I fly with this airline there is a 3 or more hour delay due to ""awaiting aircraft."" One time is was because the pilot was in a different city and had to get to Boston to fly out, which took 5 hours! Another time the plane was awaiting the crew which was coming from a different city apparently. Then the plane was just delayed leaving its first departure city and we were never told why just that as soon as it gets in we would be on our way. This is just ridiculous. First off I had a connection flight and was not notified of the delay. Secondly, they had no one at the desk to assist customers trying to find a new flight and when I finally found someone at a different gate, who was semi helpful, she informed me that the next flight out would be 15 mins before my new scheduled departure time. So in my experience this airline is all about delays if your current flight is coming from another city. I get it, things happen but this airline really needs to improve its punctuality.

The seats were a nice size. I had never flown with United before and was pleasantly surprised. Although I was sat next to morbidly overweight people on both my flights the seats were big enough that the people next to me did not squeeze onto my seat like they usually do on Virgin flights which I liked. I was late getting to the gate (very much my fault) and the initial employee I spoke to was rude and short with me and refused to even see if I could make it to the flight even though my baggage was still on board and the food was not yet delivered to the plane, she told me ""no, you aren't getting on the flight"" and refused to even see if it was a possibility. Thank goodness for the other lady who phoned someone, told me I was fine to get on the plane because they were waiting for the food and my luggage was still aboard, and sent me through. I slept most of the flight to the UK. The touch screen with my seat on the way back to the USA was really finicky which was a bit annoying, I liked the selection of movies and that they played as soon as I was sat in my seat rather than waiting till after take off for them to work.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Sai,United States,7/28/2015,"Delays were not announced to passengers in a timely manner and lack of assistance in order to accommodate or aide in booking other flights for customers to either reach their connecting flights or to their destinations was displeasing. The way the United Airlines handled my partner's luggage that was left behind at our originating destination was a stressful start to our trip. Upon arriving at the airport around 5.45pm to catch our 8.20pm flight, flight 5237, from Sacramento to Los Angeles, on Monday July 20 2015, we checked in promptly and breezed through security. We sat by the gate with a plane that sat there for as long as we had, little did we know this was our plane. By the time boarding came around, our flight was delayed for another hour, occurring multiple times for the next few hours. It was my hope that during the initial delay the service desk would help customers explore other options to reach connecting flights and/or destinations to avoid delays or issues upon arriving in Los Angeles. We were worried about missing our connecting flight the entire time. The second delay hits and people began to be frantic and changed flights. My party and I anxiously wondered if we were going to make our connecting flight or if we needed to rebook online. We called customer service a few times to inquire about alternative options but were never offered alternatives until hours later right before the last delay was lifted after 11am and needed to quickly decide on either taking the flight or flying out of another airport. I am baffled at the lack of customer service. My second and major complaint was the issue with our checked luggage getting left behind in Sacramento as we made our way to Cancun. We checked in before 6pm and sat at the terminal looking at the same airplane the entire time until we boarded it only to find out my luggage was never placed on the same plane.

Last week my bag was only 4 lbs overweight and I was charged the enormous amount of $200. I realise that there are reasons for charging for overweight bags, but there are plenty customers who are overweight and are not charged extra for seats and there was also lots of youngsters travelling with 2 large pieces of hand luggage struggling to carry bags along the aircraft walkway.

I used to be able to listen to the radio in the armrests with my own headphones, but they removed them and I am incredibly bored, cannot get to sleep because of how uncomfortable the seats are now!

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Deborah Scott,United States,7/26/2015,"As a child our family always flew United. However, it has gotten progressively worse through the years to the point that I would rather pay a more for a ticket than fly United ever again. Our family of 5 (one of whom was a special needs daughter) was to fly from Buffalo to Chicago to San Francisco to Anchorage where we were to then start our Alaskan cruise. Upon arriving at Buffalo, the check in machine didn't work right. The lady behind the counter was nice enough but said she could not help us with gate-to-gate connection (e.g. passenger carts) as that was something ""you didn't do"" and simply didn't seem to care that we had a need. In Chicago we sat on the tarmack for almost an hour before we took off, causing us to get in late in SF for our connecting flight to Anchorage. We ran to our gate as best we could with our special needs daughter, saw our plane sitting at the gate, but weren't allowed to get on due to the gangway being pulled away from the plane already even though the United personnel told us, ""Oh, we knew you were coming. We just couldn't wait for you.""  To make matters worse United booked us on a flight to Anchorage for the next night. In the end we got flights on Alaska Airlines and got into Anchorage about 2:30am which allowed us time to sleep in our booked hotel room before making the trip to Seward by bus, getting us there in plenty of time to board our ship. Alaska Airlines personnel were superb in demeanor, helpfulness, and care, something that United personnel were seriously lacking. Our return trip from Vancouver, BC to Buffalo started out much differently than when we went. The staff in Vancouver were helpful and courteous. But once we got to Chicago, they were anything but! I think the personnel of United Airlines in the US could take a few lessons from those from our Vancouver neighbors.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Brian Fox,United States,7/22/2015,"On Sunday, June 14th, my family and a close friend took a flight from Newark Airport which should have connected in Toronto to a flight to Dublin, Ireland. Unfortunately, because the Captain of the flight did not turn up for his passengers, the flight was delayed for approximately 3 hours. (United Airlines staff in Newark informed us that this was the reason why we were delayed.) This was not a weather-related incident. In any event, this delay caused us (and others, I believe) to miss the connection in Toronto. We were not rebooked to another flight. Instead I was told that all of United's flights that night and following day were ""oversold"". I asked if we could fly home and was told that that would take days as well. The customer service rep in Toronto was particularly nasty and actually slowed down the entire process by training a new employee while talking to us. It should be noted, that I was traveling with my 5 year old daughter who had not eaten for many hours and the slow processing and communications by this rep meant that nearly all of the shops and restaurants in the airport had closed down for the night. I asked if we could be put on another airline and was told that this was 'not allowed'. I also asked if we could get a flight somewhere near Dublin and was only offered a flight to Turkey or Frankfurt the next night. The rep did not offer hotel vouchers or food vouchers or any practical resolution, but only intentionally took her time scanning flights. The employee finally got us a flight to London the next night and rooms in the adjacent hotel. If we had not fought for hours, late at night, we would have been left to sleep in the chairs of the airport with my 5 year old daughter. While I am grateful that we finally were able to get on another flight - to London, then Dublin through British Airways - we missed 2 days of our trip. Coming home we had another ordeal with United. The return flight which was changed to a departure in Dublin to Washington D.C. and then, on to LaGuardia was actually worse. While turbulence cannot be helped, one of the flight attendants hit her head. This meant that paramedics had to care for the attendant first, which delayed our flight and caused us to miss our flight home. I had to rent a car to get home.

What kind of company works this way? A completely full flight, not only shows up hours behind schedule, but all of the sudden has no crew? Complete blasphemy. Rude attendants.

We were served a pre-takeoff drink and then a two course meal, which consisted of mushroom soup and a beef salad/egg chicken sandwich.

For a five hour Pacific crossing all we got was one drink service and food purchase which is unacceptable. After a four hour stopover we boarded again with the same procedure.

However, as this was a single aisle aircraft some passengers needed to go the bathroom and with drink service going on the access to the bathroom was restricted.

The newly upgraded international service included boxed wine (horrible) and an appetizer to enjoy with your beverage. However, the appetizer was a cracker and a piece of cheese and that was served with the dessert.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Sara Smith,Canada,6/26/2015,"Denver to Calgary, I had checked two of my bags online the night before, and on arriving at the bag drop they proceeded to try and charge me an additional $500 US. I was checking three bags, my suitcase was under 50lbs, my boot bag which is usually checked in conjunction as one bag with my ski bag, and my ski bag. The lady helping me, who was trying very hard to try and lower the price, ended up knocking it down to about $300 US. Part of this issue was that they charged me for oversize and overweight for my ski bag. Most airlines charge a base $100 and the weight doesn't matter unless it's over the 70lbs max weight. Another lady working had rudely told me that I was not allowed to have three pairs of skis in my bag, even though there was nothing I could do about it. She ""let it slide"" and charged me instead.

Total door-to-door travel time for this flight was about 14 hours. All staff was courteous, pleasant and efficient. WiFi entertainment system that streams TV and movies over tablets worked well, and provided lots of options. No problem finding my flights. The planes are so packed (this is industry wide, not just United) there's no flexibility in the system for weather delays. This also makes them uncomfortable. When I got annoyed enough that I tried three times to upgrade to Premium Economy hoping to score an empty center seat, United's App steadfastly refused to take my money, so I stayed wedged back in the back of the plane. Would I recommend United? Yes. They're no worse than any other carrier.  The benefit of United though, is you can get their service at more locations than just about any other airline.

I found  rudeness characterizes how UA treats its customers. For example, it was clearly printed on my e-ticket that prepared meals would be provided, but what they do not say is that you first have to ask about the meal (flight staff never mentioned that food was even available), and then you are told to look at the menu if you want to purchase any food. The same goes for WiFi which they claimed was available, but did not work even on a flight within the mainland US. As for entertainment, I am sure that you could have a great selection, but they charge you for watching everything and anything, including TV programmes. Inflight staff were rude beyond belief. Aside from behaving as though they were doing you a favour by even noticing that you were on the flight, several of the staff would openly talk about and complain about passengers within hearing distance of the passengers themselves.

The two legs to HKG and ORD were fine, in fact, I arrived a hour ahead of schedule in ORD, giving me a comfortable 3 hours transit. The incoming aircraft for my connection ORD-DTW came in a hour late, and by then we were caught in the storm and flights were grounded. We boarded the aircraft twice, and were told to deplane. Eventually the flight was cancelled. A 3:50pm flight to get me from ORD to DTW, I was still in ORD at 930pm. I can't get my checked bag as there is no procedure for that, and it will be on the next flight out to my final destination. We were given discounted hotel coupons, and I was rebooked on a 4:07pm flight the following day. As it was only 4 hours by bus from Chicago to Detroit, I decided to take mega-bus rather than to fly, and thank goodness I did that, because the rebooked flight on the next day was again cancelled due to air control issues! My bag actually arrived at Detroit earlier than I did, and I had to make a trip to the Detroit airport to get it. My woes didn't end. 10 days later, I was going to get back to Singapore from Reagan (DCA-ORD-HKG-SIN). At Reagan, I couldn't check-in, because my entire itinerary was cancelled. I didn't get a reason for the cancellation, and got rebooked on the same itinerary. Alright never mind that I have middle seat for all 20 hours flight. At ORD, I tried to see if there are other seats available at the gate, and the staff was very rude, and unhelpful. ""There are only middle seats available, what do you expect me to do?"". She did not even try to look at my tickets. If she had, she would have seen that I got rebooked on economy plus, and telling me that would have made me feel better about the 15 hours flight. Onboard the plane, I was lucky, and only the aisle seat on the row behind me was occupied, and I was able to have a restful flight on a window seat.

At the last minute, as part of the closing doors announcement, the flight attendant announced that entertainment was only available through the United app, which she stated should be downloaded while we were on the ground. I'm fairly certain there was a charge for the entertainment, plus a charge for the necessary wifi connection. The premium economy was okay. It did have extra legroom and more recline (my big issue) than regular economy seats, but the width was barely adequate. And the aisles seem to have gotten narrower since I last flew on a plane.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,C Shearon,United States,6/20/2015,"As a loyal United Airlines customer, with Global Service status for years, that following experience has helped me realize United neither values my business nor cares about my experience with their company. On May 29th my direct flight from Dulles to Kuwait was diverted to Istanbul. The pilots timed out and passengers were stranded for over 12 hours in Istanbul- with no Turkish visas nor United staff to re-book and assist with hotels (United has no service in Istanbul, agents were eventually flown in from the Middle East). Indeed diversions are neither planned nor pleasant; however, passengers anticipated United would have had a contingency protocol in place for such events. After being left to fend for ourselves, and spending hours on the phone (international roaming) with customer care, passengers finally reached Kuwait the following day to ultimately learn that the remainder our respective original itinerary were canceled meaning onward travel and return flights to the US had to be re-booked. Shockingly, United did not apologize for the inconvenience and (as of today- eg. 23 days later) has not offered to reimburse visa-on-arrival fees in Turkey nor the international roaming fees passengers encountered while trying on the phone with United’s “Customer Care” team. Furthermore, all passengers paid for the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, boarded the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, and apparently since United diverted to Istanbul, zero miles for the Dulles to Kuwait leg will be applied to passengers’ account as credit toward their annual status - seems unfair if United accepted the payment for the flight and we all boarded the flight. After over a dozen conversations with “Customer Care” leading all the way up to the Senior Manager for Global Services, I am deeply disappointed to say the agreed upon follow-up that was supposed to occur 5 days ago has not. The Senior Manager did have one of his subordinates send an e-mail stating they will be in contact as soon as they reach a conclusion to my request. Wouldn’t it have been nice to receive a message stating “Thank you again for continued business and patience, we value your business and as a customer and respectfully offer our apologies for the inconvenience, reimbursement for the incurred expenses, and credit of the earned miles” ?

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,K Rakow,United States,6/19/2015,"Domestic First Class/International Business Class, ORD-EWR-MXP. Purposely booked a 2 hour connection at EWR given United's timeliness issues as of late. United changed the flights shortening the connection to 1hr 20. Called and had changed to a 3:25 hour connection. Stated I did not trust United with the shorter connection despite it being legal when challenged and the agent made the change without further comment. The outbound flight was late due to weather. Unfortunately all other EWR flights were showing on time as was the departure to MXP. Little communication from gate staff in Chicago. Arrived over 3 hours late in EWR with departure to MXP showing on time. After a sprint to the connecting gate, the MXP departure pushed back multiple times and we finally boarded about an hour an a half late. Typical ‘old United’ flat bed which I like better than the Continental flat bed as it seems to have more leg room. Pillows and blankets have been upgraded. Ordered my meal on a tray in one go so I could sleep and all but dessert was delivered when everyone else was getting their first course. Food was decent, much better than old United. IFE is sparse with less content than a few years ago but I have gotten in the habit of bringing my own and the power at the seat kept everything charged. Cabin staff basically disappeared once the meal was served – no one coming through or replenishing water. They appeared about 1:30 before landing for the breakfast service. We arrived about an hour late but the bags were delivered in a fairly timely manner and all of the bags arrived. My return was cancelled and I ended up on Lufthansa all of the way back. Much better, especially seat comfort and reliability, except for the food which I always find a bit odd on LH. Frankly, I am starting to pick other airlines when I am in business class and I have the choice. In my opinion, United has become very undependable, both from a timeliness and baggage delivery standpoint, since the merger. Much of the US hub counter staff is now outsourced and they are of little help when something goes wrong. The hard product and service is average to slightly below average.

We had also requested upgrades on all flights to Business First and had been approved on our outward and return flights. Then my fears were realised when one hour after checking in online for our flight to SFO I received an email informing me the flight had been cancelled due to the inability to find a crew to fly the plane from SFO to Sydney. After a frantic call to United we were put on the LAX flight which left 2 hours earlier the next day. Of course we lost our upgrade but the customer service rep was good enough to put us in Economy Plus at no charge. Again my fears came back when we were at the airport to be informed that the flight was delayed due to the inbound flight being delayed at LAX.

The food itself (cheese ravioli) wasn't bad at all, again much improved from my last trans-Pacific last year. It's a US airline, so you still have to deal with the occasional long-tenured yet disgruntled flight attendant, but overall I didn't hate the experience, which is saying a lot for a 12 hour flight in Economy on any airline.

When we called the nearest ground staff attention, it was like she doesn't want to do her job. On the bright side, she gave us a priority tag for our baggage. The problem didn't stop there. Even our in-flight experience was hell. The food was far from edible. It was my first time to encounter a long-haul flight where you have to purchase snacks for a minimum of $8.99. There were no individual screens for entertainment and the wifi wasn't working properly. Flight attendants were rude, yelling at passengers that they can't do this and that.

These trips on United were a nightmare.  One of these flights was cancelled and United made no effort helping us to get another flight, so we had to book an additional flight on Southwest, causing us to lose a day of our vacation. Two of these flights had delays of 45 and 40 minutes sitting on the tarmac waiting to get off the planes.  On one of these flights, the seating was cramped and the cabin was hot. Service on the planes was mediocre at best. United's response to these situations was that they were not responsible.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,I Bortolo,Australia,6/13/2015,"We were very disappointed with the service onboard our United Airlines flight from Toronto to Sydney. Changes to our departure times were text to our phones while we were already at the airport. Ground crew were dismissive of passengers who asked them any questions and were more interested in personal discussions than getting their job done. The cabin crew were very underwhelming and not accommodating passenger requests, to the point where you were not allowed a second cup of coffee because they had cleaned up and put everything away. The inflight entertainment cut out for our side of the plane and crew were not interested in doing anything about it. After 4 resetting attempts, the screens worked again. This being our second flight in 7 days we were expecting a little more enthusiasm and pride in their work from crew members. Being seated in economy class and not up the front meant that by the time our meals were served they had run out of popular items and we were left without a choice. No apology from crew, we were met with there's none left and this is what you can have. No attempt to salvage the situation at all and since this was a 14 hour flight, it was a long time without food. Of course, we were welcome to purchase an assortment of onboard snacks at very inflated prices. We will not be travelling with United again as this has not been a pleasant experience at all.

As a loyal Delta flyer I transitioned over to United because they offer direct flights into Newark. What I've learned - you pay double the price for United as opposed to other airlines for delays and cancellations due to ""flight crew availability"". I had the opportunity to speak to a flight attendant about my weekly (yes every week) cancelation or delay and was informed that United was contracting crew out due to limited number of employees. Most employees have left because United pays them dirt. Shame on United and shame on the airline industry - those of us that fly on a regular basis (3 weeks out of the month) pay premium prices for a terrible experience. When I call or contact United - they could care less. Hence my loyalty to Delta - they listen acknowledge apologize and reword you for any and all challenges.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Janice Wahl,United States,6/6/2015,"On May 22 2015 I flew from Newark to San Diego on a United B737-800/900 aircraft. This was the second leg of a flight home from Europe. The plane is fairly new and it is one of the most uncomfortable planes that I have ever been on. And that includes the medium and smaller commuter jets. This was a six hour flight. I booked this flight seven months in advance paid extra for the economy plus seating and selected a bulkhead isle seat in row 8 which was behind the ""first class"" section of the plane. However between the ""first class"" section of this plane and my row is what can marginally be called a restroom. It was a six hour flight and this tiny bathroom with a sink barely big enough to wash your hands was in constant use. Each time the bathroom door was swung open and closed those of us in the adjoining rows were assaulted with bathroom smells. After a few hours in the air I noticed that the bathroom smells were more intense and that the floor next to the bathroom door was wet. I spoke to the purser who jumped up and immediately locked the bathroom door and took it out of service. That was a good temporary fix. However I would like to suggest to United that they consider removing that toilet unit from this plane configuration. It really ruins the flight for those stuck in seats close by. Also this plane has hard vinyl seats and headrests and no entertainment screens. The seats on Southwest are more comfortable.

From the beginning there was a noticeable lack of service at the airport a very casual approach to almost being a big yawn. We boarded a very crowded old Boeing 757 it was scruffy dirty and the flight crew even scruffier. We had paid for Economy Plus and a bulkhead all added extra's happy to pay when the service is provided in this case the seats were so narrow it was hideous the galley to our right was occupied most of time by a flight attendant who was more interested in himself than anything else the rest of the crew appeared very uninterested even the First Class crew could not smile. The continual line for the restrooms required us to keep moving our legs never again. We were showered in ice cubes from the galley twice I ordered a cocktail to help keep me calm $14 AUD for a drink such a rip off it was basically thrown at me. What has happened to United? We vowed never to fly with them again now here comes the kicker we had a return from LAX-HNL in late May a 777-200 lovely aircraft two roomy seats on the side in Economy Plus and some of the most charming flight crew I have met.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Allen,United States,6/4/2015,"I was travelling from Orlando to Anchorage with a connection in Houston and San Francisco. When we arrived at the airport our flight had already been delayed by an hour and half meaning that we would miss our Houston connection. I went immediately to the service counter to have it sorted out and they had already switched us to a Delta flight transferred our bags and arranged meal vouchers for us. I was surprised at this high level of service. All in all we arrived in Anchorage on our Delta flight only 10 minutes after we would have arrived on our originally booked flight. Our travel experience back to Orlando was a completely different matter however. After arriving at Anchorage airport and checking in I realized that I had been bumped from my originally booked aisle seat to a middle seat in the same row. After boarding I realized that the seat that I had originally booked remained open so I simply picked up my stuff and moved to the seat I had originally purchased. This was simply an annoyance and source of confusion rather than a true inconvenience. The flight itself was rather uneventful. We made it to San Francisco made our connection and waited to depart. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Initially we were told that we were waiting for some baggage from a connecting flight they presumably boarded the baggage and we began taxiing. After taxiing for a few minutes the captain came over the speaker and informed us that we had to return to the gate due to a ""water leak"". We then sat in the plane for 2.5 hours while multiple maintenance men stomped on and off the plane trying to locate the source of the leak. After sitting on the (hot) plane for about two hours I had already finished the bottle of water that I had brought on board. When I asked one of the flight attendants if I could get some water she told me that I couldn't have any water because the maintenance man was standing in front of the bottle. Is that the one and only bottle of water that United stocked on this particular flight? I wandered back to my seat and endured the additional thirty minutes of idle waiting. Finally the pilot came back over the speakers and informed us that the ""water leak"" was actually condensation from the coffee maker that the flight attendants failed to wipe up after the last use. Needless to say this made for some pretty incredulous passengers.",,,Economy,,4,2,2,1,1,,,2,0

By the time the plane arrived in Houston my flight to West Palm Beach had left and it was the last flight of the day.

At any rate I am very happy with the service I get from UA and even though I live near ORD I have had very few cancellations or delays of significance flying in or out of Chicago. Prices are competitive and schedules are great making it very easy to co-ordinate travel to Asia or Europe. While I fly Delta and SkyTeam partners occasionally I will fly UA and partners if at all possible. Most recent travel was 747-400 ORD-HKG outbound to Taiwan and MEL-LAX (787-9) and LAX-ORD (757) homebound.,,,Premium Economy,,10,4,5,5,5,,,5,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,M Stockman,United States,5/16/2015,United improbably informed us two days in advance that our flight from Albuquerque to Denver connecting to Minneapolis would most likely be delayed? Good to their word they got us to Denver an hour and a half late missing our connection maintenance issues was the reason. We had managed to rebook our connection in Albuquerque the agent assuring us our luggage would remain in Denver. Now it's 10pm no luggage and waiting in line with approximately 400 people to get to one service desk. 2 Hours later we have a hotel voucher and nothing else talked to some low level manager who couldn't understand why 2 full fare first class customers were upset after all we got a free hotel room.,,,First Class,,1,1,3,3,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,C Davies,Australia,5/13/2015,We recently flew the Dreamliner from Melbourne to LA with 3 of our sons. We have flown United before on the old 747's. the Dreamliner is just beautiful great inflight entertainment larger windows which you can control making it darker with the touch of a button very friendly and happy staff always makes the 14 hour flight a lot more pleasant. The food was really good and the beverages were a good selection not too sure about paying for a beer when most other international airlines include that in the fare.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Karen Sethi Walker,United States,5/12/2015,"I had the worst experience on United Airlines today. I was told I couldn't board the plane with my 4 month old infant because of weight restrictions on the plane. 6 people were told they couldn't board the plane including myself and I found out that was based on our fares. I was penalized because I planned ahead and booked my ticket for less money. It doesn't matter that I started my trip hours earlier or that I connected and arrived to the gate on time. Some kind soul did try to volunteer their seat. I overhead the gate crew saying there was a mother and baby who should board next which was superseded by the supervisor who said full fares trump everything. I left my house at 4.45am to catch a flight to connect to Chicago so I could get to my destination in the shortest time possible with a sleeping baby. I am a frequent flier a ""MileagePlus Explorer"" (which I pay for by having a premium credit card) yet here I am - the only person with a child on my plane-prevented from boarding because my $554 fare wasn't enough to get me my reserved seat.

The plane was old and dirty and the flight attendants were old and fat. They never smiled or greeted you - clearly hate their jobs. The announcements were like the ones you hear in school. Don't do this don't do that - militant. I had booked a Swiss flight I thought. The inflight entertainment and food were very poor compared to other airlines. No water bottles given out just cups. Cheap. The toilets were smelly and there was no amenity kit you see in other airlines.

After waiting an hour in line to check in I get to the counter and find out it was two late to board my flight. This was after getting up at 3 am in the morning just be sure I was there ahead of time. There is no excuse for their incompetence. They spent my valuable time chatting with one another amongst themselves at the counter and not warning anyone in line that there was a danger missing there flight or even showing effort to work faster.

We had two hot meals (full + snack) three full beverage services and at least 3 or 4 juice/water services. I was dreading a narrow body long haul flight but United did it right.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,T L Wilson,United States,5/6/2015,"I booked our family of (3's) flight months in advance all seats were requested together and I prefer sitting next to the window because it seems to help my severe motion sickness. Per experience I usually allow a 90-120 min layover if I have a connecting flight which if you fly out of Pittsburgh it is almost impossible to get straight through flights unless you fly Southwest where unless you are a bouncer you cannot get a window seat to save your life. The flight from Pittsburgh to Chicago was on 'mechanical delay'. The 'mechanical delay' was about 90 mins which meant we would not make our next flight out of Chicago to our scheduled event that evening. However when we landed at O'Hare we were unaware that several flights were being held because of our delay. I asked a United staff member at our departing gate about our flight and he said ""it's departing in 3 minutes you will not have time to make the flight"". I went immediately to the Customer Service desk where many of my fellow passengers were congregating. While standing there my party heard our names over the loud speaker to board our flight. One party is physically disabled. Unfortunately we did not make the flight and we missed the first half of the event that evening. United should have contacted the gate to let them know we were on our way should have made arrangements for a cart for the disabled passenger in order to get us there in a timely manner. This one simple communication act would have taken less than 1 minute.",,,Economy,,2,2,1,1,1,,,2,0

We were forced to travel on to Melbourne where we waited on the tarmac for 2 hours until we knew whether we could disembark. It turned out that we did all go into the airport and then were given lunch vouchers. We waited 3-4 hours and then got back on our plane bound for Sydney. I checked to see if I could catch a flight from Melbourne to Christchurch but was told by a UA attendant that there were no more flights to Christchurch from Melbourne I was given a motel voucher for a night's stay and continued on to Christchurtch via NZ Airlines the next day. All in all everything was handled well flight attendants gave extra cookies we were updated frequently about what was to transpire and I think all the passengers were happy that our safety was the most important thing to the crew.,,,Economy,,9,4,5,4,4,,,4,1

Every single person flying United had issues! My son's flight was cancelled due to no pilot. United then put him his wife and 4 yr old son on another flight. They had to fly from San Diego to Washington DC then to Cancun to make matters worse the weren't even seated near each other!!! How can they do that with a 4 yr old. I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours early and almost missed my flight because it took over 1.5 hrs just to check my bag and then was treated horribly. When we finally got on they plane the flight attendants were not friendly whatsoever and United in their ultimate wisdom decided that 7 meals would be sufficient for this 5hr 50 min flight. I fly at least 4-5 times a year and usually enjoy it. I will never fly United again. It was a nightmare.,,,Economy,,1,3,1,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Rebecca Nelson,Canada,5/1/2015,This is the second time I have flown United and it will be the last. The first time all the planes were late and we kept getting bumped to later flights. When we did arrive the luggage did not and it took four days to get the luggage. The second time I flew first class. After we checked in in Toronto we were put into a large area like cattle with no services and then lined up and herded through customs at the last minute so we were unable to get breakfast or buy magazines etc. one bag did not arrive with us but went to Newark instead of San Francisco. On the way home I was bumped to a different seat so I was no longer flying with my spouse and when I called I was told that is just how they roll and even in first class full fare seat booking are suggestions. In the future I will be flying Delta. We flew Delta last year and it was a much different experience.,,,First Class,,4,5,4,5,3,,,4,0

The 757-200 on both sectors was clean tidy and all features of the business first cabin in good working order.

Our family booked our flights in January from San Diego to Florida. Sometime in February the flight time of our second leg of the flight was changed by about 5 minutes. Didn't think much about it. Just yesterday my daughter was checking her seating arrangements and realized that when United changed the second leg of the flight they dropped all our seats. There are no seats available. No help from the United reservation person who I could barely understand. We're all sitting apart. Good thing we checked our seating or we might not even had a seat.

Very disappointing when you can't choose what to watch on an 11 hour flight! In addition the level of service is not as good as Asian airlines that I've used on the same route such as Cathay Eva Air Singapore Air etc. When I asked to refill a water bottle the flight attendant said I would need to go to the galley myself to have it filled. I've never received such a response on Asian airlines. Will definitely avoid flying United in the future if I can help it.,,,Economy,,3,3,1,2,1,,,3,0

Husband was platinum level. This was never an issue so of course I moved aside to comply and consolidated four into two plus purse. Purse an issue so gate checked bag. Fine. Got on board. To add insult to injury. Weather delay due to lightening and hail in Florida and major storm system in Houston area. I had had my United flight diverted last week.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Stephen Mordey,United Kingdom,4/24/2015,I took a trip from London out to Rio De Janeiro and from there to Sydney and back home after another stop over in Rio. My travel started on April 1st on UA 5 from London to Houston. I'm a 1k and upgraded this whole itinerary of about 48000 miles of travel from economy to business using mileage and a cash fee. All upgrades cleared in advance allowing me to select my favourite seating which on United one can do free of charge. I continue to be impressed at the level of courtesy and service in United's premium cabins. The vast majority of cabin staff gave very good attentive and professional service. Good simple food but very enjoyable and well presented. The fish dishes continue to be my personal favourite and were quite delicious. Frequent drink refills no need to ask its just given. Some really outstanding flight attendants. Some customers dislike the business class seating personally I have no problem with it. After a nice meal and plenty of snooze inducing beverages I can literally sleep for hours. The only downside in the whole trip was the closure of Houston Airport as a result of thunderstorms on 16/04/15. This could not be avoided or blamed upon the airline. End result I arrived at Rio on my way back 24 hours late. As a 1k a free phone call to a dedicated phone line got me rebooked on the next days flight keeping the upgrade. But I have to say that I did not envy the legions of poor souls who had to stand in line at Houston Airport that night to receive the same service from customer service. It seemed like hundreds of passengers waiting to see one or two agents working at 2am and it was not a pretty sight! All in all thirteen long haul flights apart from the one delayed by weather all other flights operated either on time or ahead of schedule. There are airlines out there that could not even come close to this level of punctuality. And as always my baggage appeared in the right place at the right time.

Seating in the Boeing 757-200 was spacious and comfortable. (We sat in their Economy Plus which offered plenty of leg room and I'm six feet tall.) Entertainment was plentiful and varied (I watched three recent movies I had missed in theatres) and the viewing screen was quite large enough.

We recently flew Nashville - Dallas - San Francisco on United (first class). Food service etc was great. But woe to the huddled masses. For some reason on the return we were bumped to business (first leg) then economy (last leg). For a six hour flight ""breakfast"" was a box with a roll candy bar and yoghurt. But the last leg we were seated in economy and the blinders came off. Seats were probably used on misbehaving prisoners - as ergonomic as a stone carving tattered ""leather"" painfully thin. Video screens (and I use the term loosely) had been randomly attached to the ceiling for which earphones could conveniently be purchased.

We boarded the flight on time everything seemed to be going as planned until the flight was delayed due to some electrical in the control panel. We ended up sitting on this flight for a good 2 hours waiting as they kept saying sorry and we will update you more in 5 minutes and then 30 minutes and overall a 2 hour wait time until they said we are sorry but we must all exit the plane and wait in line until we could get booked for another flight. Once booked for a new flight they gave us food vouchers the new flight they booked me on was at 2.55pm it was only 11am so I was expected to wait with an infant for another 3 hours - a long day waiting me with my son. I then received a notification on my phone that the flight they rebooked me on had been delayed 90 minutes which would have meant being stuck in Houston airport where my connecting flight was but that I would have missed by the time the new flight had arrived. I was then put on another flight leaving Fort Lauderdale at 5.15pm and arriving to my destination at 11.18pm.

I would give higher marks for seat comfort except both ROC-ORD and ORD-ROC segments were on a regional partner using an ERJ-145.

This is the world's longest 787 route at around 15 hours so I would not even had considered flying United if they were using their old 747 with no IFE. This flight was excellent to the point I was wondering if I was actually flying United. I was in economy plus (which is not premium economy) but the extra legroom for a small surcharge really makes a big difference for such a long flight. The plane was brand new with excellent Panasonic IFE with very clear screen USB and power at every seat Wi-Fi which worked well for the entire trip good food and polite service. This was the best United flight I have ever taken and really feel they have a competitive product on this route (competing with QF A380). The only negative would be that you have to depart from the hideous terminal 7 at LAX. The return flight arrives at TBT to clear customs so think it would be much improved experience if UA international flights could depart from TBT as well.,,,Economy,,9,4,4,4,5,,,5,1

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Ridderhof,Australia,4/10/2015,Travelled SYD-LAX-LAS and GCM-IAH-LAX-MEL and found the airline to be well above average. Whilst some of the aircraft are a little older the LAX-MEL leg was on the 787-8 and we were upgraded to premium economy (economy plus) for that leg - possibly the most comfortable flight I have ever been on. Flight attendants were typically very cheerful and despite the large amount of legs no complications with baggage. Food was fine entertainment on the long-haul flights was pretty good. In any respect they performed much above my expectations and don't deserve a lot of the bad rap they get on this site.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,4,4,,,4,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,R Cross,United States,4/10/2015,I flew United from KIAD to DXB in economy and really liked it. I wasn't very optimistic about the airline when I read reviews on it but United surprised me with how good they were. The ticket was the cheapest I could find. I have flown on several different airlines and United served me one of the best meals I have ever had on a plane. The seats were big and comfortable since United has a good seat configuration. United uses a 3-3-3 seat configuration unlike many airlines that uses a 3-4-3 configuration on their Boeing 777's. The flight attendants were nice and helpful. The inflight entertainment was good with a lot of the latest movies and TV shows that kept me occupied the entire flight. I would recommend this airline to anyone.,,,Economy,,10,5,3,5,5,,,4,1

Departed LA near enough on time flight uneventful until approx 3/4 hr before landing. We were informed by the Captain that because of bad weather we were to be diverted to Brisbane. In Brisbane we were told to stay on the plane until further notice. With only minutes to spare before the cut off time for Pilots and Crew expired we approached the runway for our return to Sydney. We only got half way when the Captain announced we were not going to take off as their time had expired. We were taken off the plane and told to wait until a new crew could be found. Almost 12 hrs later and a frustrating lack of information we were told that finally they had a crew but no pilot then we had a pilot but due to administration problems we could not leave. After a 15hr flight and 12 hrs sitting in an Airport we were all tired and at the end of our resolve.

When we asked why they customer service representative told us that our flight had been chosen at random because of the weather. We were told to either wait at the airport for 12 hours or we could pay for a motel. In my opinion the motel should be provided if the airline has the ability to just randomly cancel flights.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,S Sullivan,United States,4/6/2015,"I made my reservation months in advance. I was supposed to have an aisle seat about 5 seats from the back of the plane. When I boarded the plane I was not in that seat. Instead I was put in the very last row by the toilet. I had work to do and tried to power through it despite the terrible seat. The seat would not recline and the gentleman in front of me reclined so there was no room. My head was just inches from his reclined seat (I asked and he agreed not to recline all the way back). I was constantly bumped as people walked to use the toilet and the smell was terrible! I asked the steward why my seat was changed he said it happens all the time. You think you have reserved a seat in the middle of the plane but it is really further back. Otherwise no one would choose the back row. So I was tricked and according to the steward it happens all the time. He made no effort to apologize or make the situation right. It is one thing to realize in advance that the only open seat is by the toilet. It is another to pay that amount of money and reserved far in advance and get ""placed"" in the back by the smelly toilet. I put 1 star for food and beverages because I couldn't eat anything even the food I brought on board because of the smell of the toilet. I put 1 star for the entertainment because it required a credit card. I would have given negative for seat comfort and satisfaction if I could have. I put 1 for staff service as the man in the seat in front of me was hit in the head by the trash bag every time the stewardess went by and she didn't even seem to notice.

The price was OK for few days notice but the in-flight experience was one I would like to forget. In the past I flew overseas with other international airlines from abroad and most treated me and my family very good. With United it was my worst experience flying overseas. Flew from Orlando via Newark to Hong Kong direct. The seats were hard as a rock which made it very hard to sleep. The entertainment system offered all these channels and music that did not work and not available for viewing. The food was terrible and small. It was half the size of a lean cuisine dinner. They charged me $8.00 for a half a can of beer. The attitude of the flight attendants were rude. Returning back to Orlando via Chicago from Hong Kong the flight was an hour and a half late which caused me to miss my connecting flight to Orlando. Got no sympathy from service desk and was stuck in Chicago for an extra 4 hours. I will not fly United ever again.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Marcel Bogaerts,Belgium,4/4/2015,BRU-ORD-BRU. On the flight BRU-ORD the entertainment system was down so we had no entertainment at all. This was announced prior to boarding so it did not come as a bad surprise after take-off. This is not pleasant on a 9+ hours flight but United compensated us by serving all beverages for free including beers wines and liquor. After dinner the attendant even proposed to pour us a cognac without we had to asked for us. This is proper compensation and client care. The food was airplane food not great but the chicken was OK and before landing in Chicago we got a hot sandwich. On the flight ORD-BRU the entertainment system was working properly but the seatback screens on the Boeing 767 were utterly small. For dinner I ordered the pasta which was dough and something like tomato sauce not very tasty. Legroom was better than on most Asian airlines and attendants were courteous and caring.

Loading for the sign-in page would stop at 80% at the highest but then would hang. Forget about it. Take-off was delayed for loading of 'catering supplies' (food that would be sold to us?).

On the way back wi-fi was available but none of our devices was able to connect (iOS and Android) stuck in ""sign in"" anywhere from 20% to 80%. The home-leg departure was delayed for loading of catering supplies (i.e. food that would be for sale?). Flight attendants are rude as if you were sitting in their furniture without asking. It's easy to use polite language and manners even if you're not sincere yet they could not muster a minimum effort. The price for this flight is quite high as much as ORD to an Asian destination but it seems more like a budget flight. I guess it's because it's a straight flight (no lay-overs).

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,L Munzer,United States,3/28/2015,"My husband is a frequent flyer with United Airlines in his personal and business travels without incident. In saying that I am a reasonable person I can understand that our flight was delayed and then cancelled due to mechanical problem. However the rudeness of the ticket agents was a total shock to me and most of the other passengers. Staff did not seem to be equipped to handle helping people re-route their flights and were flustered and unprofessional. It is very difficult for me to express my disappointment in the way the situation was handled. The only apologies we received were from the airport security officers who showed up at gate 29. There were no announcements stating that they (the ticket agents) were going to help us with connecting flights there were no apologies for the inconvenience of having to sleep in the airport no announcement that first class passengers and those with small children would be found hotel rooms and others would be left to their own devices to sleep at the gate. Some water and sodas were provided but not enough for everyone. The ticket agents seemed to be ""put out"" in trying to help us. Isn't that their job? I believe that customer service is a huge part of any business and if you don't have good customer service you have nothing. No food vouchers were offered unless asked for this I found out by asking a fellow passenger where he had received his vouchers.It should have been announced that everyone would receive these after a long night sleeping at the gate. The lack of communication was shameless and again unprofessional! I believe there needs to be some training with the staff at United Airlines Maui to help in dealing with situations such as cancelled flights and exhausted guests. And regarding the 125.00 voucher we received for the inconvenience of this debacle doesn't come close to compensating for the discomfort and inconvenience of having to sleep on a filthy airport floor!

United's 737-900 series aircraft are nice but the leg room provided hardly warrants first class. Wifi failed on every leg except SFO-IAH. If you navigate off the personal entertainment offering to wifi it is impossible to get back. So if the wifi fails - which it often does on United - you have nothing. Meals were improved over past on a couple of legs the same poor food as on the others. Wines still bad. Boarding ridiculous as Group 1 is now huge with no preference to First Class. I've flown the airline for years because of its dominance at SFO but take other Star Alliance airlines when going overseas. United had delays on both parts of return whereas others I knew on Jet Blue out of JFK (down a runway) got out on time. May be time to give up my 1K and go elsewhere.,,,First Class,,4,3,3,3,1,,,2,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,H Parker,United States,3/25/2015,I had my first and hopefully last experience with United Airlines this past week. I flew round trip to Orlando with a friend for spring break. Our flight down was delayed three hours because of weather which is admittedly not United's fault however we missed a connection in D.C. and had to fly standby on a later flight that put us at our destination 6 hours after we were scheduled to arrive. The return flight was the real terror though. Our first leg from Orlando to Chicago was fine except for the airline insisting on checking our carry ons through to the final destination. Once in Chicago we were told our flight to Burlington was delayed due to mechanical problems. Eventually we boarded the flight an hour late and took off. We then turned back and circled O'Hare for an hour and a half due to mechanical problems before making an emergency landing and having to get off the plane. They then cancelled that flight after leaving us sitting for two hours while they tried to find another aircraft. At that point I was told there was no way to get me to Burlington before Sunday night (my original flight was Friday morning). I tried to book a flight to a nearby city and was told it was impossible to fly anything other than standby. I was booked on a confirmed seat to Albany for Saturday morning and tried two standby flights Friday night. My friend made it out but I ended up in the airport overnight (I was not offered accommodation). When I went to board my flight Saturday morning they informed me that there had been an error and the flight was overbooked. I was bounced from that flight and booked on one departing in the afternoon. The afternoon flight was cancelled due to mechanical problems and I was unable to get out until Saturday night at 11 pm. After all that they refused to even consider shipping my bag until I had landed in Albany (it had been shipped to Burlington on Friday). It is now Monday and I still have not received my bags. Their customer service is unfriendly unhelpful and refuses to let you speak to someone in charge.

This will put us in Chicago too late to make our connection. This means we cannot fly out till the next morning. United will not give us a voucher for anything because the delay was not 4 or more hrs. I looked at Denver weather radar and there is no bad weather. Gate people keep saying bad weather. Maybe there was down the line but not in Denver as they are insisting. So they don't have to supply vouchers for this late leg. The week prior I was booked on flight out of Houston.

First the boarding. Group 1 which includes first class had about 90 people in Shanghai with the line stretching down the corridor. In fact there were more people in group 1 than in group 4 or 5. So much for First Class. The front cabin of B747 is old and dirty. Seat 2A has more privacy than most but overall the first class cabin is tight with very little privacy and people on top of each other. The seat is long and comfortable and you can sleep. The flight attendants…- one was pleasant and the other really did not care about anything. The food was horrible cold appetizer awful salad. The food lack warmth/taste/presentation.

Otherwise the food wine and entertainment were excellent and the seat made a very comfortable bed.",,,Business Class,,6,4,4,4,4,,,2,0

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Hilinski,United States,3/9/2015,"We traveled from the United States to a resort in Punta Cana. On the return trip our flight was delayed out of Punta Cana by an hour. This created a very short window of time to catch our connecting flight in Philadelphia. A plane was too close to the baggage area which delayed our bags and caused us to miss our connecting flight. We were then told there were no other flights that evening. (It was 8.30pm). The next available flight was at 9.45 the next morning. We were then informed that since the delay was because of ""airport traffic"" United was not responsible for paying for a hotel room for us-she did provide us with a pink card that would allegedly provide a cheap rate for us. After calling the number on the card that this upstanding United Airlines representative had so generously given us we learned that the nearest hotel we could stay at was 50 miles away. We were fortunate to find a ""Parking Spot"" driver who took us to a nearby hotel where many other stranded United Airlines customers ended up that evening. I hope to never have to give another dime to United Airlines and have told the travel agent to avoid them if at all possible.",,,Economy,,1,3,1,2,4,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,B Goldman,United States,3/9/2015,I flew from Puerto Vallarta (PVR) to DC with a connection in Houston. There were literally thousands of people waiting to check in to United flights in PVR with lines stretching the length of the entire terminal. Only four check in desks were open one was even closed. There were no announcements and a United rep went through the lines asking for passengers on the next flight only once. Flights out of PVR were delayed by as much as 2 hours or more. There was no help in Houston for people who would miss their connections. I arrived at my gate just before the door closed and the sullen attendant at the desk refused to ask permission for me to board. A few minutes later the door even opened to let out a passenger who had been checked into the wrong flight and the (now two) attendants refused to try to get me on board. This was the last flight out to DC and as a result I had to stay overnight in Houston. All told it took me 26 hours to travel from PVR to DC entirely due to United's incompetence and non-existent communications. A true nightmare.,,,Premium Economy,,1,2,1,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Jodi Zigler,United States,3/9/2015,We booked a flight from BWI to IAH for 2/22 at 7.10 am and were scheduled to arrive in Houston at 9.45 am. Instead we did not arrive until about 8pm. It was an all day ordeal and we lost an entire day of our vacation. United had mechanical issues on flight 234 but after many delay announcements it took them until about noon to cancel the flight. We sat on the plane for a short while then for many hours in the airport until they cancelled it. Then we had to go all the way back out to check-in to wait in a line for about another 2 hours to be told there were no flights at BWI to Houston that day. United employees were few and far between not nearly enough to handle the re-booking of an entire flight. Eventually we were bussed to the Dulles airport for a 4.30 flight to Houston. We were not given any food and United employees were short-tempered and quite helpless. I heard other passengers say they received food vouchers so I couldn't help but wonder why we were not given anything. Maybe it was because we were Travelocity customers rather than direct customers with United or maybe it was because we were very easy and never mouthy or difficult with anyone. On our flight from Dulles to IAH I was seated in a middle seat separated from my husband which was very difficult because of all the turbulence and my motion sickness. Our experience with United when flying back started out much the same - computers down very long lines and few United employees to help. After check-in the process finally improved and our flight back to BWI was smooth and uneventful.,,,Economy,,1,3,1,2,3,,,1,0

The outbound leg on antique 757 and 767s made me long for the good old days of air travel circa 1995. Far more comfortable than the return leg on brand new 777 and A320s. The older aircraft had wider seats and the flight from Chicago to London was less than half full so I had a full row to myself. The newer aircraft were by comparison more cramped had uncomfortable seats and were completed packed per the norm. The seat back entertainment systems were non-functional. Food was ok.

No longer do they allow the usual 1 checked bag free which is the standard on international travel. $25 for my wife's bag and $25 not overweight not oversized just a regular bag. Seems now any checked bag now is charged for shorter international flights. Plus to make matters worse for some bizarre reason Grand Cayman will not let you go through security with a fly rod despite having flown all around the world with one and no problem from any other security. So now this has to be checked which becomes a 2nd checked bag at $40. $40 for a couple 30"" long by 1 1.2"" diameter tubes taped together! At least that one was only on the return leg. I travel a lot and while I cant say I will never fly United again since there are limited options anymore but it will flat out have to be my only option to a place I really want to go to.

I liked Continental a lot so United when acting under the Continental side is wonderful. However I got a bit more ""tulip"" and less ""globe"" on my flight from Miami to Newark. The check-in and gate agents were wonderful as usual but the flight was delayed two hours before taking off from Miami. I completely understand this but I feel that more could have been done to get on the plane sooner. I cannot complain about the seats they were comfortable and made of leather (or a similar material). However I was appaled by the lack of entertainment. To a completely literal extent the options consisted of SkyMall United's horrifically boring magazine and the one radio station I could hear which seemed to be an 80's synth station. There was no Wifi no plugs and no TVs not even one. I believe this is a remnant of United. I flew the same route on Continental in 2010 and I received sufficient television programming. If I'm flying in and out of Newark a former Continental hub I deserve Continental service. Let Chicagoans keep their United I'll keep my Continental.",,,Economy,,6,4,4,1,1,,,3,1

For years we travelled with Air Canada or Air New Zealand and this last time we made a big mistake and decided to fly with United. We prolonged our arrival to Auckland by a few good hours but we would have co-oped with these extra hours had it not been for the awful time on the flight to and from Auckland. There is no room for peoples legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples health. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants beyond rude. I was shocked when 2 of them who could not decide if the liquid in the pots was tea or coffee simply removed the lids and put their noses in. When we got to Sydney Australia we embarked on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland. What a huge difference. All of the sudden we could stretch our legs. The food was edible and the flight attendants were courteous. Going back home to Canada the experience repeated itself. We flew Air New Zealand to Sydney and everything was good and then hell repeated itself when we had to embark Untied from Sydney to Canada.

After 2 hours the captain said that the flight was cancelled. I was sitting on the upper deck. When the flight crew were walking out of the flight deck they saw us all sitting and asked why were we still in our seats and did they not tell us that the flight was cancelled? We told them that no one made the announcement! Half an hour later the gate agent came in and told everyone in Chinese that the flight was cancelled they repeated in English that we should get off take our bags and proceed to door number 24 near Burger King where there would be a bus to take us to the hotel. They did not say which hotel or which bus. Everyone was confused which way to go. After much shouting by the mob of passengers they lead us to passport control. We went through but could not find out how to get out of immigration. Together with another passenger found gate number 24 but there were no people or buses. I found a United staff member who told us that the door had been changed to #23. We went out and there were 4 buses. No one knew what we were saying as they did not speak English. Luckily a Chinese woman came and we found the bus to learn that they were taking us to Sheraton 1 hour away. I decided to go to the Airport hotel which is in the terminal instead and pay out of pocket. They have arranged for the same plane to fly tomorrow at noon. This is an unscheduled flight.

Our flight on 2/5/2015 from Maui to LAX was UA417 an ancient 757-200. We paid a total of $4924.40 for two round trip tickets. Flight 417 was more like riding an old dusty city bus. Keeping in mind that we were in first class we were offered only a small bag of potato chips. That was it. We were told that there were no more snacks and we could have only one bag of chips. The flight attendants mainly sat in their jump seats the whole time just chatting or snoozing. The purser was pretty snotty when asked any questions. We had the old style seats that didn't recline much. And beyond our belief on the ongoing flight from LAX to DEN we had lay-flat beds. For a flight lasting less than two hours.

I'm an average meat and three veg type of guy if I pay a beer price I don't expect to get Champagne service. Who does? I was more than happy with the service provided given the fares I paid. I recall only once one of the internal flights was delayed and it really wasn't a big deal. I would definitely fly with United again.

Our 13-hour flight was delayed for three hours after we had boarded because of radio issues. About 30 minutes into the wait they opened up the main door and with temps outside around zero the F cabin quickly became a freezer. I could actually see the breath of the pax in 4A. The cabin itself was tired and dirty with tissues stuck between my seat and the wall. The toilet rubbish bin overflowed about halfway through the flight and was never emptied. The toilet seat was filthy by the end of the flight. WiFi was broken. On the bright side the amenity kit comes with a United-branded ballpoint pen and comb. The food apart from a cold but well-cooked tenderloin steak was largely inedible. The “sausage” that came with the dry crusty omelette was a hard brown puck of mystery meat. Food in ANA Y is far better. There was no wine list because there were only four mediocre wines and some cheap sparkling in 375ml bottles. Service was not rude for the most part but below economy standards on any Asian carrier. I had to wait 10 minutes to get a cup of dishwater coffee. When the woman seated next to me asked what the squid sushi was the FA replied (with a smile to be fair) “Don't ask me I don't make it.”The shoulder harness that F pax are required to wear on takeoff and landing was extremely uncomfortable. When I remarked on this (politely and with a smile) to the FA while putting mine on she patronizingly replied “We can endure anything for a few minutes Mr. Johnson.”Will never ever fly United long-haul again.,,,First Class,,1,2,1,1,2,,,1,0

On the outbound leg there was a medical emergency on-board and the United flight crew was totally unprepared to handle the situation. If a medical kit was on-board it wasn't made available to the medical personnel who tried to provide assistance and it took 15 minutes for the Flight attendant to bring a wet towel to help cool the patient down. Our return flight was delayed by almost 5 hours with not even ""we apologize"" for the delay from United. Then our bags were placed on a different flight that didn't arrive until 1 hours after our flight and the bags didn't show up at the airport until 4 hours after we landed. Again no apologies from United. then we got numerous texts from United about the status of our bags. One even claimed the bags arrived at IAD 2 hours before we did.

The crew never addressed anyone by name-I think there were 6 of us and when my aisle mate had trouble finding the chest belt the FA motioned and pointed rather than walking to the seat to assist. The dinner was OK but there was no style in its presentation-or of any of the meal. The crew was present when necessary but had no real interaction with any passengers that I observed. The breakfast was insipid. Again poorly presented eggs lukewarm and the potato patty was soggy and blah as was the some-kind-of sausage patty. All in all it was a simply so far off the ""First Class"" moniker that I arrived feeling nothing but annoyance. The return from Narita was much better. United still lacks any sense of presentation or style but the crew was friendly present and engaged. The meals were both better than those on the inbound more tasty and hot but still far off the mark that is achieved by other airlines not only in First but even in Business. I used miles but had I paid the full freight I would have been furious at what was delivered. I will give UA credit for its hard product.

When I asked what was on their food menu for purchase another roll of the eyes and was informed it was in the book in front of me. Leaving the plane you could almost hear the flight crew heave a sigh of relief the flight was over and they were rid of us the entire plane load. We were pried into our seats with a shoe horn and never in all my travels have I felt so claustrophobic - the 3 hour leg of the trip was almost unbearable to sit through.

I have not seen even one friendly FA during my two flights. During SJU-EWR leg we weren't even greeted while boarding the plane. It felt like a sarcastic joke when they showed a safety video at the beginning of the flight with smiling crew greeting you since all you see on board is sad tired unprofessional crew. The flight was 90 minutes late due to an electronic glitch in one of the plane's systems. Even though many were going to miss their connections in FRA there were no apologies given - just a statement of facts. Pilot announcements consisted of mumbling something intelligible into a PA system couple of times and when it was brought to the attention of a FA she responded ""Oh yes I know I could not understand him either"". Thirdly it is a meal service. Food itself was inedible but this is a common trend of many airlines so I did not have any expectation in regards. The main issue was what they call service on board United or total lack of it. There were no smiles no ""enjoy your meal"" no ""what would you like"" just appalling ""what do you want"" and throwing it at your table - truly ""the friendly sky""! There was a row and a half of passengers forgotten during the beverage service and FA had to be reminded to serve us some drinks. I understand mistakes and miscommunication may happen but a little ""sorry"" would be the right word to say. There were none! And lastly is the seat comfort. I understood that new United modus operandi of the economy class is to squeeze you towards the back of the plane into old uncomfortable seats with no leg room (in which no one should be allowed legally to seat for more than 2 hours) so you would spend a hundred or so bucks for the Economy Extra next time you fly with them. I also however do believe that even the most affordable on-board service class should include some basics of travel and hospitality: decent amount of leg room (not extra but just sufficient) acceptable service and a friendly crew. Anything beyond that should be considered extra and come for a price of course that customer will chose to pay or not.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,S Jansen,Germany,2/6/2015,FRA-ORD-LAX-OGG. All flights were in clean planes with enough legroom (I've 183cm of height). IFE on international flights depends on the aircraft but on B777 and B767-400 its working well with a good choice of movies. Staff friendly (with one exception) food compared to other airlines (e. g. Lufthansa) much better. We missed our flight in ORD due to a 45min-delay in FRA for which United was not responsible. We could Hotel vouchers in Chicago flew to LAX and OGG the following day and arrived in Maui about 20hrs late. OK we missed one day in Maui but we got compensation (350USD for each passenger).,,,Economy,,6,5,3,4,4,,,5,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Mohammad Afsar,United States,2/6/2015,"Frequent flyer here. Worst flight experience I have had. Flight was supposed to be 53 minutes long. Got 44 minutes delayed due to late arrival of the plane. After boarding 15 minutes delay due to ""technical difficulties"". Smallest plane I've been in. Even though I wasn't planning on checking in my backpack the plane was so small that most passengers had to give their carry on luggage to the flight attendants to pick up from the luggage claim later. After landing (59 minutes after we were supposed to) the baggage claim carousel wasn't turned on until 35 minutes later! 2 other flights' passengers have landed after us collected their luggage from the carousel next to ours and left. Finally 40 minutes after landing (which is unusual for a domestic flight at a small airport) they started providing our luggage. The only good part about the whole flight was the behaviour of the pilot and the attendant. My ride was waiting outside for an hour and a half and I was extremely embarrassed. Never again.",,,Economy,,1,1,5,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,P Kerins,Canada,2/6/2015,Recently travelled from Fort Lauderdale to Vancouver on 2 different United Airline flights. I have never complained to an airline before about leg room until now and have been travelling since 1976. If you tried to seat your pet into an area as small I think you would be answering to a higher authority. That's how bad it is folks! They actually allow passengers to recline their seats during the flights so you know the rest of the story!,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Tom Wooge,United States,1/30/2015,In-flight service is long out the window video entertainment is endless infomercials and the last scraps of legroom have vanished into thin air. On a recent full flight from Newark to Los Angeles a new super skinny seating was encountered that climbs to a whole new altitude of pain and suffering. When reputable airlines change to slim seats the airline gets more seats on the plane and passengers get a bit more legroom but at United this would never fly. United now using Continentals short-haul 737-900s on long-haul routes has extra extra seats that don’ t quite fit. To make passable exit row clearance seats behind are compacted to even less than their typical 30-inch seat pitch on this aircraft - less than the 31-inches specified for many other flights - and much less than the 32-inches United advertises when selling economy seats. My seat had only 2-feet clear butt-to-shin with perhaps an additional 4-inch knee-high seatback thickness - probably a 28-inch pinch - or less! When the passenger in front tried repeatedly to recline - there being no extra room it was impossible. The passenger drew a cabin attendant to complain that I would not allow the seat to recline. The attendant seriously explained to me that the passenger had purchased a ticket entitling them to my leg space and may fully recline the seat. Unfazed the attendant told me that if I wanted extra legroom I should have purchased an“Economy-Plus” seat. I asked how much it would cost but there were no free seats - at any price. I explained that I did not need extra legroom just sufficient room - which they were not providing. Not reconciled to the laws of physics the attendant continued insisting that this was all my fault - that I was taking up space that I was not entitled to - and had me turn sideways putting my knees in the aisle so the seat could recline. My shoulder was now in the way of the seat. I could not turn back either and complained that the vending carts would hurt my legs even more than the seatback. Only then did the attendant finally suggest that the other passenger switch seats with their adjacent small child. For $25 a luggage bag had more space than me - and was treated much better!,,,Economy,,2,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,C Copeland,United States,1/30/2015,My family and I flew United for the last time over the holidays. We bought tickets the previous March in order to get direct flights to the west coast and seats together. We chose to fly out of Logan - very inconvenient for us but the only airport offering a direct flight. A few weeks before our trip we received an email telling us that our flights had all been changed. Now we were leaving hours earlier getting in hours later with stopovers both ways. These flights were on Christmas day and New Year's Eve - clearly a few hours made a huge difference. Also our seats were no longer together. I will never fly United again. Customer service is terrible.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,L Singleton,United States,1/28/2015,Never again will my family and I fly with United Airlines! We flew in from Sacramento to San Fran and we missed the connecting flight to Hawaii because of their delays. We had to wait 2 hours then fly up to Seattle and then to Hawaii which made a 5 hour flight over 6 hours! On the way back from Hawaii we had a flight connecting us from LAX to Sacramento but missed it once more because we were sitting on the Tarmac for 40 minutes doing nothing. There were no more flights to SAC so we had to spend the night in LA. My husband 2 sons and I are now missing work and my 2 other children are missing school. Missing the flight once was bad enough but a second one is totally unacceptable. Both times the planes we needed to get on were sitting there and we were only late by minutes and they wouldn't let us on. We missed a whole day in Hawaii because of it. Also on the flight with UN from Hawaii to LA there was no complimentary food.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,I Williams,Switzerland,1/28/2015,London to Costa Rica via Newark. Check in was quick and efficient. flight to Newark left on time and we landed 20 minutes early. The 777 was clean well equipped and comfortable. In Flight service excellent and food and drinks plentiful and good including the ice cream and caramel that was very impressive. Transit through Newark was somewhat long but that is nothing to do with the airline. Flight Newark to Costa Rica was on time. Aircraft was a 737 of some age but the seat was fine and the crew excellent again. Food and drinks again good for a short haul flight. So my experience of United was a good experience and well worth trying as the tickets are good value and extremely competitive against other carriers.,,,Business Class,,10,5,5,5,4,,,5,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Clifford,United States,1/28/2015,MDT-IAD-LAS-ORD-MDT. Other than the leg from Dulles to Vegas the trip was largely a non-event. Even that leg the only real complaints I have is that it (B-737) was fully booked and the WiFi system on the plane was spotty. I do not recommend paying for the on-board WiFi systems until you've spent some time in the 'complimentary' area to make sure the system is working properly. The MDT-Dulles leg was a 25-minute trip not especially worth discussing. The Embraer 145 is a nice little plane the single-seat arrangement on the one side of the cabin does make a nice opportunity to get both a window and aisle seat. LAS-ORD was aboard an older 757. Seats were more comfortable than the 737 but in-flight entertainment was limited to basically an old Discovery Channel program on overhead CRTs. On the other hand it was free so I guess you get what you pay for. This plane was also fully booked but got lucky with a smaller woman in the center seat. ORD-MDT was aboard an A-319. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was available over a wi-fi connection to my tablet. Worked like a charm. Large selection of programming. Plane was about 80% booked and I got lucky with an empty center seat. On all 4 legs cabin crew was attentive and reasonably pleasant. Flights were on time or at least close enough that I had no trouble making connections. Notes: Bring a tablet or something to occupy yourself with. When the in-flight entertainment is right it works well. When it's not you'll be twiddling your thumbs without some way of entertaining yourself for hours. Do use the United app. Having the boarding pass on the smart phone - and getting all the necessary updates through the app - made things easier. It worked reasonably well. When traveling within the US (on any airline) don't go non-stop coast to coast. 5 hours on a fully-loaded plane is miserable (and lets face it they're all close to fully loaded today). An hour layover in some place in the middle is now a welcome respite and no longer a nuisance. Be prepared for delays. Stuff happens on every airline - mechanical and weather. My reading of the other reviews complaining about United strike me as largely problems that every airline is guilty of in some way shape or form. It is simply the reality of airline flight in 2014. Airline travel just isn't what it was 20 years ago when the planes were half full so there was more room and the cabin crew was not so rushed.,,,Economy,,7,5,5,3,2,,,4,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Epstein Dominique,France,1/28/2015,Flight 914 from CDG to MCI with connection at Washington Dulles on Jan 14 in Economy class. The product featured by United is sub-standard. Of course ageing aircraft in the main leg (767) is clean and well maintained and this is the minimum you can expect from one of the largest airlines in the world. Check-in boarding operations baggage everything ok. Seats are standard. VOD is poor with very limited options and not user friendly. The music program was out of order for this flight and films not plenty. Besides on individual screens maps are not detailed and this system is less advanced than 20 years ago (I am not joking) in Asian companies. Also flight information is given exclusively in feet inches miles just if the metric system does not exist in the rest of the world! Regarding meals they are almost edible. We had chicken with some sauce (more sweet than sour) a large salad with a too smallish cup of dressing (good) and a kind of sponge cake pompously christened crumble – wrapped in a cello paper printed European quality but made in Alabama. All in a very small slippy tray complimented with picnic cutlery (100% plastic). And of course passengers have to pay 7.99 $ for one beer. Ridiculous. By the way a sandwich (not bad) was served before landing but do not expect more than water between meal and snack. Fruit juices ice creams and other open bar is a dream out of reach at United. Attitude of cabin crew very professional (attendants have apparently about 20/25 years experience) working efficiently but not cheerful (friendly skies really?) in very bland uniforms which could be copied from Railways of the 70’ Being familiar with Asian and Middle East airlines I find United well below what you may expect from such a large corporation.,,,Economy,,4,3,3,1,2,,,2,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,R Cahill,United States,1/28/2015,United Premium Economy is a gamble it seems to be directly dependent on the type of aircraft you are flying. On a 777 the seats are nice and spacious the services (seatback entertainment) are premium and you can really feel the extra legroom making the extra charge totally worthwhile. On a 747 the opposite is true I had more room in Economy on an Airbus than I did in Premium Economy on a 747. On the 747 I couldn't even fit my very small backpack under the seat in front of me and what little legroom I had was obstructed by a large piece of plastic. The aisles were noticeably narrower as well which made every beverage service an exercise in getting smacked with a cart (not fun on a 13 hour flight). I did notice there was an extra seat in every row on the 747 which is probably were all that extra room went. Also relying on the old school movie screens meant that even if you were trying to sleep a bright light was shining in your face. On the bright side as always the crew were nice courteous and professional. Long story short though? If you're going to spring for the Economy Plus make sure you're on the right type of plane it makes a big difference.,,,Premium Economy,,5,2,4,3,3,,,2,0

United plus is not a better seat or service just more leg room which is the least of the issues unless your over 6 feet tall. Beer and Wine are now $7 each!

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Alison Pockat,United States,1/26/2015,We had truly horrible service from the first flight out to the last flight of the return trip. United booked us to fly into Newark to connect with a flight out of JFK - we got the joy of finding this out when we checked in. On the return flight from Zurich the cabin crew announced that they were short staffed due to management cut- backs. Translation in our case where we were seated near the rear of the plane is that we got one small sandwich six hours into the flight. I would have killed for a glass of water and maybe some food. Then our connecting flight to Raleigh was cancelled due to 'weather' and therefore we were responsible for our own sleeping arrangements. The 'weather' in Raleigh was drizzle. Our bags went American and arrived on time. A complaint to United was not even met with an apology. Instead they offered of a $100 voucher for future travel with them!,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,3,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Alex Ross,Uzbekistan,1/26/2015,I try to avoid flying United when I can but as I was with Continental I sort of inherited their frequent flyer program. So my review is of a recent flight this last summer but also of their frequent flyer plan which unless you are a Business flyer I would avoid. It's almost impossible to move up to Gold with them. I flew 50K miles flew on them 4 times but failed to spend 5000 dollars on their tickets because I live overseas and usually fly Turkish and claim the miles because I thought they were in the same alliance which it turns out isn't really true - at least not for United. The flight we took was from London to Houston. Cancelled because it's United and we were placed on a flight to NYC in an effort to get us to a flight that connected to Texas which we missed so then they put us on a flight to Chicago so that they wouldn't have to pay for a Hotel etc ad nauseam. Funnily enough our flight back to London from Texas had one leg cancelled because it's United and they told us to drive from Austin to Houston but that's another story altogether. The plane we were on from London to NYC was just about clean enough my gluten free meal was gone because it's United (My flight had been cancelled and my meal with it) and the entertainment system was down because it's United. Needless to say I am now with the FF program of Turkish Airlines and will never fly United again unless it's impossible due to US monopolistic practices. Don't fly United.,,,Economy,,1,1,2,1,1,,,1,0

Not too disappointed since it was still a Dreamliner but the change to the smaller aircraft had the consequence that a baby was moved from the forward business class to the 3 Business rows in the mid-section. A baby on 16 hrs flight - not recommended. Flight departed from LAX 1.5 hr late. Basically waited on board for 1.5 hrs. Everyone had already boarded so we were in this plane for at least 17 hrs. Flight uneventful new Dreamliner is a really great airplane large windows very airy cabin. Seat is good except that not every seat has direct aisle access. Inflight Entertainment great good selection of movies TV shows. Service was attentive (above usual United average) Food was decent. Unfortunately United does not supply their Business customers with Fast passes for Melbourne Airport Immigration so waited almost 1 hr to get through on top of the 1.5 hr delay.

There was no turbulence we were on top of the cloud layer. There was no turbulence during descent as well. I feel the seat belt sign was turned on to avoid further service to passengers.

I have been a loyal CO customer for about 20 years and have tried so hard to like the new United but my patience has definitely worn out. The service inboard is simply too hit or miss and increasingly miss. The FA's treat passengers like a necessary evil to be served minimally and with zero smiles or grace. The service is functional at best and once completed the FAs hide behind the curtain. Worst still their planes are already showing signs of ageing - on the outbound flight my moms seat reclined minimally and then jammed so she had to spend the rest of the flight bolt upright (she refused to switch with me). Notably the same seat was still broken 10 days later when she took the same flight home on clearly the same plane. Crew were indifferent to the seat problem. BA and Delta both have far more dependably good service and UA has simply stopped trying. I did a DL Gold status match for 2015 so will ditch UA after all these years.

I did not accept and got across with Air Canada but ended in Toronto rather than USA. Had 5 internal flights in the US scheduled time seems an approximate time not a target for UA. I boarded in Washington on UA803 via Japan with same flight number going to Singapore. After boarding we sat excess 15 hours in the plane awaiting for UA to finish their maintenance. Arrived Tokyo only about 40 minutes late but was told too late to board the 803 flight to Singapore. On arrival I had a good 30 minutes and only hand luggage.

United has the worst food and in-flight entertainment in the industry. The flight attendants want to serve you food immediately after the flight begins so they can chatter in the forward and rear galleys of the airplane. Low fat potato chips and cookies are not a snack they are the lowest cost food options that you can offer your customers. United Airlines overall is of the worst carriers for inflight services in the airline industry.

Checked-in at the dedicated business class desk and was advised that UAL use the ‘Aspire’ lounge at EDI. The lounge was fine with a reasonable selection of food items for a snack breakfast. Flights are not called from the lounge. Boarding appeared to be well managed a number of supplementary security / travel questions were asked by an agent at the gate. Once onboard a welcome drink of champagne juice or water was offered. There is a 2-2 flatbed seat configuration in Business Class. The seat was comfortable with plenty of space and easy-to-use chair and In Flight Entertainment controls. The plane Departed on time at 09.05. On board service began roughly 45 minutes after departure. The main meal was lunch followed by a snack prior to arrival at EWR. In my opinion this is where UAL need to put more thought into what is offered. In view of the time of day prior to 10.00 a full breakfast or brunch rather than a lunch might have been a better catering option? The service from flight attendants was efficient although some of them appeared to be a bit tired looking. Small touches such as addressing passengers by name were absent on this flight. This was done on the inbound UA36 EWR-EDI 8 Jan 15 in comparison. The flight arrived at EWR around 35minutes ahead of schedule this was partly due to an on board medical emergency situation.

It was 10am and they claimed they had no way to get us home that day unless we spent $80 to take a shuttle to another airport and then took two more flights from there. They then charged us three times for our bags. Overall (not including the two extra bag charges) this cost us an additional $180 and they refused to pay for a cent. I will never fly this airline again. Also as a side note as we spent the entire day in the airport we noticed that they overbooked every single flight some flights were overbooked by more than 10 people!

The flight from Cancun was delayed 1.5 hrs leaving us under 40 minutes to go through customs re-check our bags and get to a different gate in another terminal. We did not make our connecting flight. Along the way there were no helpful attendants and no actions taken to give us even a fighting chance to get to our gate. They attendants on the plane had no information about gates connecting flights or any other helpful info. We missed our connecting flight to New York. We kept getting sporadic ever- changing alert texts from United. Sometimes the flight was delayed by 2 hours and then reverted back to half an hour. We did not received a comped hotel and had to spend additional money staying the night at Houston. We were re-booked onto a flight the next day at 10.21 am. We arrived at the airport approximately two hours before the flight. Tthe flight was delayed 54 minutes and would now be departing at 11.15am. Shortly after we were told that the flight was delayed for 2.5 hours departing at 12.45pm. Having been up and at the airport since early morning we were famished. We decided to use the restrooms and grab a quick bite to eat as we had a 4-5 hour flight ahead of us. In that extremely brief time the flight time was reverted to 11 am. We received the notification at 10.30. After the flight was delayed 2.5 hours we made the rational decision to eat something in the meanwhile. Does United expect that it's customers not get up from their seats to relieve themselves get a drink of water or a quick bite to eat after having waited at the airport for so long? We missed our connecting flight again due to incompetence and poor customer service. We immediately went to an agent where we again received attitude and condescending lectures.

On our return trip on 18th June 2014 the HNL-IAD flight was more than 2 hours late and the connecting flight to LHR on 19th June was boarded then disembarked as the plane was faulty - and we ended up with a 3 hour delay.

We talked to customer service at both airports and they refused to make any changes unless we paid $59 to upgrade to an extra leg room seat.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Jonas Hutter,Germany,1/14/2015,"FRA-EWR-PHX-EWR-ZRH. FRA-EWR on old 767-300 with a tiny little screen in front of you that shows some movies on channels. Own earphones did not work. Plane very loud. However seat quite comfortable very nice cabin crew and good and tasty food. Legroom officially at 31in. but feels bigger than on transatlantic BA or AF. Brought my own entertainment so I had an excellent flight (should have brought earplugs though). EWR-PHX on newly refurbished A319 with slimline seats. Again lots of legroom even for me (6'6"" / 2m) and again no IFE but wifi available. But again a nice crew with two full drink runs (alcohol for purchase) and some walk throughs with water. PHX-EWR on 737-700 also with new interior and AVOD. However this is provided by DirecTV cost is $5.99 for flight of two hours or less and $7.99 for flight of more than 2 hours. Sadly even the flight information part is enclosed here so you don't see it unless you pay for it. Again two drink runs and good service by nice flight crew. Of the four planes on this trip this one had the worst legroom but still OK. EWR-ZRH on 767-400. Old plane with brand new interior - and a good one at that. Slimline seats with a big screen in front of you a large choice of new movies games and shows. Legroom again very good the 31in. at United appear to be bigger inches than those on other airlines. Tasty dinner and small breakfast (with fresh fruit!). After reading many bad reviews I had mixed feelings about stepping into a United plane. I even considered doling out the (quite big amount of) $$ for Premium Economy. But I got corrected. All planes were clean and well maintained nothing rattled or fell of. The crews were all nice and helpful. Legroom was never an issue even with pax in front of me reclining. After this experience I highly recommend United. Before you fly - find out if you have to bring your own entertainment (or pay for it)!",,,Economy,,9,5,5,5,4,,,5,1

No further explanation on the matter except that the plane never left. The United staff that rescheduled our connecting flights was extremely rude and not helpful at all. It almost seemed as if she was taking joy in the fact that we were all stranded there. Then every passenger was forced to stay the night in Houston. My flight was supposed to be the first flight out of Houston leaving at 7am so I get to the airport at 5.30 am to find out that now it doesn't leave until 9:00. Every single staff me member I've encountered or asked for help from is miserable and rude. This was a one time thing but I will never ever fly United again.

We upgrade to Premium Economy for the 13 hour flight for comfort. Immediately we were grounded for 2.5 hours because the plane wouldn't accept the fuel. So all passengers including us who had to transfer in Narita were going to be late. Once finally in the air all audio wouldn't work. To add insult - the stove and cooking equipment wouldn't work either! For this 13 hour flight the attendants served us frozen turkey sandwiches with ice cream. United staff did announce to everyone that they were sorry for the poor service. They did pay for our hotel we were checked in at 3am and had to been on the next flight at 8am. The good news was the flight from Singapore to Bangkok was on Singapore Airlines. They are always in the top 5 airlines in the world for a good reason. On this 2.5 hour flight we had much better service. United needs to completely overhaul their policies from top to bottom.,,,Premium Economy,,1,1,2,1,1,,,1,0

Second leg killer flight to Australia almost 15 hrs upgraded to Economy plus which was disappointing because basically is the same as economy with just a wider seat pitch that gave me more leg room and a comfortable sleep. Food just fine the trays are getting smaller and smaller crew was nice and attentive plane a bit old IFE average small screens with a good selection.

Same on the LAX to NY and LAX to MEL. Food was reasonable drinks were served regularly cups of water offered often and service was second to none. I had heard all manner of criticism about United beforehand however decided that given the effort by United to revamp the airline putting the 'Dreamliner' into service non-stop between MEL and LA it was only fair to give United a fair chance.

We missed our connecting flight and we had to wait in Anchorage with our three month old son for 8 hours. We didn't get a meal voucher or anything. The staff that worked for United told us that we weren't entitled and it was too bad. They gave everyone free movie on the plane but my husbands didn't work.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,C Fisher,United States,1/11/2015,United looks appealing simply because it offers more choice and times. In previous years it has been my first choice. Each time I was hoping the problem was just a fluke. The last 3 United flights all had huge delays and poor handling of the situation. The delay was not reported until after boarding time and passengers were not assisted with missing their connecting flight. Staff were rude and the planes were not very clean.

At LHR the staff were very helpful in sorting out our ESTA cock-up (kids' passports had been changed since applying for ESTA). That is the only positive about United. The seats are uncomfortable and cramped the choice of in-flight entertainment poor (even if you could see it on the minuscule seat-back screen) or for the 2 hour flights pay-TV and the food absolutely disgusting. No snacks offered (I guess they are worried people will fill up on these having tasted the food) although available to purchase and no complimentary alcohol. Attendants fairly average and could certainly do with a better corporate uniform on trip out. On way back distinctly poor. Most worrying was the man who was on our plane and about 20 mins before take- off realized he was on the wrong flight only when somebody else came to sit in his seat. How is that allowed to happen on United from Washington? From a security point of view it is unbelievable and I wonder how the poor bloke fared trying to find the correct flight. Oh yes and over-booked flights which I thought were a 20th century thing.,,,Economy,,2,1,2,1,1,,,2,0

I also booked the flights with my partner and put us seated together and when we printed out our boarding tickets they had moved us so we sat separately on the flight. We then flew from LAX to Sydney Australia. Once again they had separated us. We were extremely annoyed that we had to spend a 14 and a half hour flight sitting in between strangers when we booked to sit together. There was no complimentary alcoholic beverages and the good food always ran out by the time it got towards the end of the plane which a lot of people complained about to the staff. Overall I would never recommend UA to anyone. Splitting up couples and putting single riders between them is a joke and not good enough.,,,Economy,,2,1,1,1,2,,,1,0

Price was the same as any other good or average quality airline. No less. Seat Comfort: average for domestic seat comfort with the disadvantage that there is no pillow blanket or other accessories offered. Food and Beverages: Here the situation started bothering me. The only available food was for sale! The only beverages were water juice and such. Everything else was for sale. Inflight Entertainment: The only provided entertainment was also for sale even to listen to music you had to pay. Staff Service: I guess this varies but it was pretty poor. Some flight attendants were not courteous and shouted at passengers who stood up at awkward times. $1000 USD 6 hrs trip with no entertainment no food (only beverages) rude attendants and semi-domestic flight seats. Moreover since only beverages were served there was a more than 6 people line to use the restrooms at all times for the last 3 hours of the flight. After traveling to Europe and South America for the last two years in different airlines I think this is a very poor service for such a high price. Other airlines give full service for about the same price!,,,Economy,,1,1,2,1,1,,,1,0

The seats didn't recline enough to sleep comfortably. The foot rest was manual and difficult to operate. The seat was not as wide as a normal business class seat. There was no TV monitor only wifi via the United app and your personal screen device. No one on the flight was aware of needing a personal device on the flight. There were no outlets available to charge a personal device if you had one and the wifi kept going out. The selection of movies was not current. Older movies and TV shows were the only thing available. The meals were awful pasta and sauce and a burrito the return flight had the same offerings other than a pathetic breakfast sandwich with paper thin ham.

On the transpacific leg I was on the Upper Deck. I continue to really like the UA Business Class seat. It has more positions and the space is well designed.

We were quite pleased with the overall experience. The seats proved to be comfortable in the sitting position. They were a bit too narrow though for comfortable sleeping even for a 5'2"" woman. In comparison my wife stated that her recent Business class long-haul flights on Qantas and Emirates had much better seats for sleeping primarily due to the greater width. She found it very difficult to get to sleep on the United seat although she noted that the United seats were more comfortable in the seated position. The length was felt to be adequate. Storage space was minimal but adequate for our needs. TV screens were very generously sized and of good quality. Food service was excellent in quality as well as the attentiveness of service and friendliness of the staff throughout the flight - deemed to be slightly better than both Qantas and Emirates in that respect.

The trip was fine. Flight attendants on all flights were very professional. Ticketing crew in Charlotte and Rochester were nice. I used the lounge in Newark and was pleasantly surprised. Food was limited to snacks but that was to be expected (why US airlines do not have lounges with food selections akin to those of international airlines is beyond me). But two unexpected plusses were the presence of showers (which I did not use) and free alcoholic beverages (albeit of limited varieties). Still the lounge was a pleasant alternative of the hub-bub of Newark. I am a fan of propeller planes and was not disappointed. Both flights in and out of Rochester were on props.

Had we known that the next leg was also going to be delayed we would have just delayed boarding and grabbed something. From Houston to Aruba the flight attendants were unfriendly and cranky. They began to offer food for purchase only to find that there was only enough food for the first 1/3 of the plane. On this long flight they only came through the cabin once for beverages. A week later found us at the United counter because one member of our group of three had mysteriously been dropped from the reservation. It took over an hour to get United to see the error. Then of course the flight from Aruba to Houston was delayed but at least we didn't have to wait on the plane this time. Flight attendants were at least cordial and offered beverage service twice. They offered food as well but we had learned our lesson and ate in Aruba! Late getting into Houston so had to run (again) to catch our next plane for our final destination.

The FA first goes to a young lady in the seat in front of me and informs her of the two menu choices. He then moves back to my row (4) and asks the woman next to me which she wants. He then looks at me and says he will be back. Then he works the other side of the aisle. He appears to be randomly moving between seats. Finally he gets to me and there is only one choice and he explained they have been instructed to service the FC cabin in order of United priority.

Every winter flights leave Denver for the 30 minute hop into Aspen. Every year some flights may not land safely and the captain turns the plane around and takes the entire group back to Denver despite having three other airports at lower elevations that would place everyone within an hour to 90 minutes by bus or rent a car to Aspen but they make zero effort to make any contingency plan for this regular occurrence year after year. On the flight return to Denver the air hostess nor pilot make any effort to make any arrangements and at the counter upon arrival of course we wait another 30 min for a gate and the pilot answers are weaker than the air hostess.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,B Aune,United States,12/22/2014,"Sat in 24D on an Airbus 320 from Seattle to Newark. This is a standard aisle seat located on the right side of the aircraft just a few rows behind the over-wing exit rows. It is one of what I call the ""back-of-the-bus"" seats featuring the new Slimline Recaro seating. In light of the trend by most of the domestic air carriers to squeeze as many seats/rows as possible into their airplanes the best thing I can say about this seat is that it was adequate in terms of breadth leg space and comfort. If you are 5' 10"" or less in height or a somewhat taller person with short legs you will be able to sit in this seat and still have a couple of inches between your knees and the back of the seat in front of you. In other words you don't have to sit upright and uptight and feel as though you cannot move or are frozen in place. The lumbar support of the seat back is neither better nor worse than any other typical economy/coach-class seat on United Airlines. I do wish that the seat cushion itself was more supportive - it felt soft and thin - perhaps because the density of the foam filler or stuffing material used is lacking. On a long flight this seat may become uncomfortable and cause you to squirm a bit or want to get up and move around. Seat recline has been reduced and I was only able to move/tilt the seat back about two inches. Fortunately for me the middle seat on this flight was empty and that made my specific seat feel less confining and more bearable as I could spread out a bit (likewise for my seatmate in the adjoining window seat of this row). The staff appeared competent and the service itself was decent. The plane appeared relatively clean and well- maintained. Lamentably there was no in-flight entertainment system whatsoever which seems to be the trend on the smaller Airbus and Boeing aircraft operated by United. To reiterate my earlier comment this seat was adequate and tolerable given the trend by the airlines of reducing seat pitch on their aircraft. Stated simply it represents the new standard in air travel for the average passenger traveling on a budget.",,,Economy,,8,3,4,3,1,,,4,1

The staff announced that we could take our carry on bag and they put tags on each of them for us and we dropped them off at the circle just as you boarded the plane. Our bags went straight through to Edmonton. Due to technical problems we left about 1/2 hour late but that was ok. Before we got off the staff read off the gate of connecting flights. That saved everyone a whole lot of time. We made it to our next plane - had about 10 minutes and that plane had to wait for our baggage. There were other passengers in our position also The staff were excellent. No food except to buy not staff's fault. No TV's again not staff's fault. The seats were very comfortable.,,,Economy,,9,5,5,3,3,,,5,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,L Spencer,United Kingdom,12/18/2014,LHR-SFO-ACV. Flight leaving LHR cancelled ground staff at Heathrow rude and obstructive wouldn't confirm flight was cancelled even though I called United direct who confirmed flight cancelled. United app also stated flight cancelled after 90 minute wait in departure lounge. Transfer to Newark flight which was then delayed leaving Heathrow as SFO passengers transferred onto this flight. Overnight accommodation provided in Newark. Return flight from SFO-LHR all London based crew utterly rude and disinterested in the role that they are paid for. 7th flight this year with United only airline that gets me to my final destination. Crew rude when I walked to the back galley to purchase duty free told me it was the busiest hour of the flight as were serving breakfast before landing at Heathrow I only went direct to the galley as message on screen advised 15 minutes remaining to buy duty free. Crew member told me she hated that message and that she would have to come and have a private word with me for purchasing duty free. Flight already booked for Feb 2015 luckily booked with flight miles so know not to expect a great service.,,,Premium Economy,,1,5,1,1,5,,,4,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,S Winer,United States,12/18/2014,"Fly the Friendly Skies of United? There's very little that's friendly about United they have become an airline of lesser quality than the budget airlines of the world. Connecting business class flight from Auckland to San Francisco via LA. The first leg was non-stop on Air New Zealand which was excellent and connected in LA to a business class flight to SFO. When we presented our ticket at the United lounge in LA we were refused entry because it was a business class ""domestic"" flight but were offered entry as a guest of another person we had met on our flight from NZ. Sadly the lounge was a worn out mess nothing more than crackers and cheese slices in packets Internet access that was just a bit faster than the old dial up connections - nothing like any of the lounges offered by carriers we had flown elsewhere in the world. On the tired worn plane a minimal offer of chips or cookies and beverages. The worst part is that the personnel seemed tired of being caught between management decisions that have reduced the quality of service to nothing more than a poor commodity and travelers that resent the carrier.",,,Business Class,,2,2,2,1,2,,,1,0

I have flown this route several times in the last 15 years and since United took over the flying experience has taken a serious nose dive. Since this route is taken by people mostly cashing in frequent flyer miles and there are not that many ""paying"" passengers United has decided that we do not deserve the amenities that are available on other routes. The first class cabin seats are very uncomfortable and are nowhere near the first class seats of other carriers for long haul flights. The plane had no inflight entertainment and there was not any power ports for charging personal devices - and this was not just first class but the entire plane. If there was another direct flight to Hawaii from Houston on another carrier I would take it.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Jorge Sanchez,United States,12/10/2014,I flew with United Airlines to save money but it turned out to be a mistake. I was traveling to Guatemala City from Dallas making a connection in Houston. We boarded the plane then shortly after got off due to a maintenance issue. Not once were we asked if we had a connection flight or explained to how they would help us get to our destination nor did they give us any updates. I had to ask what to do. I was supposed to be at my destination at noon. I arrived at 10.30pm. Similar incident on my return - took me all day. Bad experience.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,2,1,,,2,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Gilberto Brambilla,United Kingdom,12/10/2014,PVG-LAX and IAH-LHR. Both flights were very comfortable. Seat and food is good. The only issue with the dreamliner (787) is the lack of proper window blinds. On the flight Shanghai-Los Angeles I was near the window facing south meaning that I always had the sun in front of me. Although the window transparency can be chanced it cannot be completely darkened and this is an issue when you want to sleep.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,4,4,,,4,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,L Richard,United States,12/10/2014,Flew United from LAX to IAH non-stop on an aged Boeing 737-700. The flight departed 25 minutes late for no apparent reason (no explanation given). Luggage was still being loaded 25 minutes after scheduled departure. Plenty of people that should have gate-checked luggage were wandering the plane looking for overhead bin space with no help from crew. There was no snack pay only food options. Nonetheless the crew was somewhat friendly passing frequently even offering warmed up chocolate chip cookies to some of the kids although some had to share one cookie.,,,Economy,,6,3,3,3,1,,,3,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Tercon Bojan,Singapore,12/10/2014,For this 9 hour flight from Houston to Buenos Aires United uses a very old 767-300 with a 2-1-2 configuration in business class. The seats are the old Continental flat-bed seats which are angled ever-so-slightly towards the window. Although it's a flat bed the bed is very narrow and at my 190cm I could not stretch out. Felt like sleeping in a coffin! Also when you have to go to the bathroom it's quite the operation to step over your neighbour without waking them up. The service and food were OK although the plastic champagne flutes and the character-less dull white dinnerware could be improved upon.,,,Business Class,,6,3,3,3,2,,,4,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Perrin Michel,Brazil,12/4/2014,GIG-IAH-NRT. I succeeded in sending my luggage directly to NRT. No need to pick it up at IAH and then check it again. Flight 1: GIG check-in staff very nice. Lounge (GOL low cost) very poor and packed. Flat seat 9D very nice. This part of Business class is much more noisy because close to engines. To be avoided at all costs. FA's very pleasant and smiling. Decent food. Poor drinks. Smooth 9 hours flight with constant info form flight deck. Surprising wide choice of IFE On time. Had to go through immigration and security in IAH. Lounge staff very pleasant. Food awful. Alcoholic beverages charged (>US1000 a glass). Fantastic shower and shower staff. Flight 2: Seat 1L. The best seat on board much more space 3 windows Silent. Same aircraft by coincidence. FA rather unpleasant and rude. Take it or leave it. Very bad food. Horrible Champagne. A nice white Bourgogne that ended after 30 min. At 11.50am lunch was completed then believe it or not no food during the next 12 hours! A tray with 2 types of frozen sandwiches was available in a corner self service. United is saving money on a 14 hour flight on food? One hour before landing greasy breakfast.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,C Charmaine,United States,12/4/2014,I may be done with United. Have had gold or platinum status for years but am getting increasingly concerned with linking flying to shopping and spending more money. As much as I hate to give up the three bags the comfortable lounges in airports it is becoming too stressful to keep up. I have almost lost respect for the airlines. Shop till you drop seems to be the key here. We are losing miles we have to spend more shop more buy the credit card. No other alliance does what United does.,,,Premium Economy,,6,1,3,1,1,,,4,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,K Chharath,United States,12/4/2014,First off let me preface that I am not a frequent flyer so I tend to give airlines the benefit of the doubt if there is ever any problems. In the past 6 months I have flown two round trips with United one was non-stop and the other had 1 connecting flight. Every single one of those flights were delayed by an average of 2 hours. I would understand if there were weather conditions that cannot be foreseen but all the delays happened in Florida and California both of which had great weather. I even signed up for text alerts to get notified of these things and my alerts either came in an hour before the scheduled departure flights or never came I'm at all. That defeats the purpose of the alerts because you should to be at the airport about 2 hours prior to your flight. When I went to ask the staff at the counter at the airport they all seemed clueless and was not able to help me alleviate my concerns at all. Some were even downright rude and short with me. These inconveniences have almost cost me to be stranded at the airport because those my friends and family were not able to pick me up. I am more than furious at the less than poor customer service that United has to offer. I've spent hundreds probably even thousand of dollars to travel with this airline but I've failed to receive the proper service and professionalism from their staff and company overall. It is sad to say but I will not be flying with United Airlines anytime again soon. I would rather pay a bit more for other airlines just to ensure that I will receive the kind of service that I should be receiving as a customer.,,,Economy,,6,2,1,3,1,,,2,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Rick Field,United States,12/1/2014,United 1064 on November 25 from Newark to Boston. I think United must go out of their way to design a seat as pathetic as is in row 32 on their 737-700. These are narrow don't recline and have no legroom. I travel a lot on business.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,N Leblanc,Australia,12/1/2014,Flew Business class between Australia and California (Sydney to San Francisco and LA to Melbourne). It was my first time flying Business class as I normally fly Economy or Premium Economy and as such I was looking forward to it. Overall I was very disappointed: food was average toilets were dirty and did not appear to have been cleaned difficult to get the staff's attention staff not willing to smile even when I was smiling at them meal service was disjointed (on one flight they offered a bread roll and some wine after I had finished my main course on the other flight they took my glass away for a refill and didn't bring it back) and the staff kept on bumping me when they walked past. The only good thing was the beds lie flat but otherwise I was very disappointed and I found that the Premium Economy on other airlines is much better (such as Qantas Virgin or Singapore). I will not waste my money on United Airlines again.,,,Business Class,,3,3,1,2,3,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,N Kapur,United States,12/1/2014,I took a United flight from GRU (Sao Paulo) - IAD (Washington DC) in Business First. When I first came to the airport I saw the flight would be delayed for 5-10 minutes. The flight time was originally 12.05 am but because of the delay it was supposed to depart at 12.15 am. So it was ok. But then after I board the flight does not leave until 12.40 am because they were waiting for passengers to board so obviously some passengers were late. In Air the flight crew was nice but they seemed like old United flight attendants to me. So they seemed a little cold to me. But the flight was good and I slept for 4 hours out of the 8 hours. I was glad the flight attendants gave my son the executive dining with out him asking. But the flight entertainment was ok. So it was an ok flight and it was better than the average United flight.,,,Business Class,,7,4,4,4,5,,,4,1

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,D Wilson,Canada,12/1/2014,"Don't pay extra for business on United. We just flew United from Vancouver to Oahu via San Francisco and are now on our way back. We paid the extra for business class - the ""breakfast"" on our first flight consisted of a scone. On a 6 am flight you don't exactly have a chance to grab a bite before departure. There was WiFi on this flight and it had personal TVs which are better than nothing but not quite up to what we are used to with Air Canada. We barely made our connection in SFO - our bags were not so lucky. The next flight had personal TVs but no Wifi. The latter would have been really useful on the long flight. At least we finally got breakfast. The flight crew was inattentive on both flights. On the way home the long haul flight back to the mainland did not have personal TVs or overhead screens but it had WiFi! That was great for as long as my laptop battery lasted but alas the old seats had no power outlets or USBs so my joy was short-lived. Both of our seats were not capable of staying in the upright position and would slowly recline. We chose United over Air Canada as we didn't want an overnight flight home. Next time we will go direct with WestJet and cram into their tiny seats in exchange for a direct flight that operates at a convenient time. We wish Air Canada would put back their daytime flight home. In summary - service and amenities on United are inconsistent even in United First. Even when they are at the top of their game it's all pretty marginal.",,,First Class,,2,3,2,2,1,,,2,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,C Piszczek,United States,12/1/2014,Horrible customer service at SFO. United flight was delayed into SFO from Vancouver so I missed my connecting flight to San Diego. We got into SFO at 11.50. I am still waiting in line with similar stranded passengers at the customer service area at gate 82 where there are two attendants helping 100 plus people. The attendants at the gates will not help us even though there is no line. This is deplorable. SFO is a United hub. There are United employees and gate attendants everywhere and yet there are only two people willing to help all these stranded passengers.

All mainline jets were in Econ Plus or Emergency Row so leg-room was great. Most flights on-time and service was good. It's so hit and miss with UA as one flight had great service and the next mainline flight was bitter flight attendants. Regional flights were good - flight attendants had personality and very friendly service. Entertainment on some flights and others nothing but a shared screen with a movie released a year ago. Other than the IAH-ORD flight all on-time. Fare was decent so overall a good trip. With UA's new requirements for miles flown and price paid I won't get Gold Status next year and that will reduce my flying with them more than this year.,,,Economy,,7,4,3,1,1,,,4,1

Excuse of 'change of equipment' from A319 to 757 not tenable as latter has even more Premium Economy seats. On arriving at gate discover that Premium Economy seats are available but now have to pay an extra $36! Customer service in United completely unrepentant of being asked to pay extra for the distress.

Paid full fare First Class only to be shocked upon check in at IAD airport that my selected seat was not confirmed. Though UA ground staff at check in counter were quite helpful they couldn't do anything except asking me to go to boarding gate and wait the problem to be resolved there. I was told UA does overbooking in all classes. I was looking forward to this flight enroute in First Class as I was connecting to BKK hence I wanted to relax. Alas I wasn't able to relax as I had to ask UA team for every 10 minutes for an update. Finally after a long argument with the gate staff I was given a a First Class seat by an arrogant lady who made one feel that she did me a great favor although it was within my right. Nothing special on this full B737-800 flight. Seat was ok with in-seat video but can't recline much.

All flights left on time with early arrivals. Outbound flight was on new 787-9 aircraft was great and seats in Business very comfortable. Entertainment with wide variety and crew were splendid on this run (old CO crew)- very chatty and went above and beyond for passengers. Return flight the same though crew a little older/colder (UA crew). 777 on return was 2-4-2 in Business which is a little ridiculous but seats were all fully flat.

Inflight entertainment was good and the seat fairly comfortable. The big let down was the crew. They were efficient but showed no personality at all and I did not see a single smile from them. The return flight was disappointing. The entertainment system offered very little choice was shown on tiny screens and from what I could see quite a few screens including mine were broken or were only showing half a picture. Again the crew were robotic with no personality at all and although efficient they seemed totally disinterested. Unlike other airlines on the route who offer a free bar only soft drinks are free on United.

Within those 6 years I have flown as a solo passenger whilst being pregnant and then with an infant and later with a toddler. I would not recommend them to a single traveler let alone a pregnant one. The only reason we continued to use this airline was due to the fact that EWR has the most quickest and convenient route home. Apart from that there is nothing that is appealing about the airline. The seats are not the slightest bit comfortable however you are able to slightly move them back to a tilt. I can disregard the seating as almost all airlines are the same but the cabin crew were obnoxious rude and definitely did not seem to enjoy their job. Asking for juice was definitely a chore for them. Next time I will not be flying United too many years of bad experiences.,,,Economy,,1,1,2,1,1,,,1,0

However the ground staff at MSP were very helpful and booked me on a direct United EWR to BOM flight that was scheduled just an hour later than my original flight. However my good experience stopped there. The premium economy seats were terrible. Not enough leg space and the head support wings were not adjustable vertically which meant anyone shorter than 5 feet 8 inches could not use them. Second there was no complementary alcohol (not even a glass of red wine) available on the 14 hour flight. I was mentally prepared for their standards but was still let down. On top of which I could pay only by credit card for a drink. Considering I was a Indian tourist the likelihood of me doing this was very low. The food was terrible and both the veg/non veg meals were almost inedible. The air hostesses were not friendly and avoided eye contact. They seemed very put upon by their job. I don't blame them as they probably had to eat the same food as us. I would never ever book this airline voluntarily.,,,Premium Economy,,2,1,2,1,2,,,1,0

I have never seen such a pathetic excuse for a lounge the snacks were questionable and the whole lounge is out dated and appears dirty. Cabin staff were clearly annoyed by the delay imagine I paid for this my seat area was sticky and dirty flight attendant was un co-operative when I asked her to clean it. I was never once addressed by my name the crew clearly thought that they were doing me a favour by even being on the flight. Food was worse than I've ever seen even for a United flight. Fortunately I took my own food we were told Restroom was reserved for crew so the 2 restrooms for business class had to serve first class. All food was prepared by bare hands and galley person eat food as she prepared it also sneezed and even scratched her head whilst preparing food. Other airlines offer pre packed nuts etc. considering the choice of other airlines that fly from the US to UAE United is way behind. Looking at Emirates lounge in Dubai or BA lounge in London puts United at the back of the line. I did arrive in Dubai and so did my luggage but the trip was far from first class and worse still some of the original crew were on my return flight and still equally annoyed by having to perform their duties. Cabin staff are obviously disgruntled and it shows I wonder what happened to the old continental crews because before the merger continental really wasn't that bad as airlines go. Today's first class on United is not even as good as the old business first on continental. Worse still one of our group who had suffered 15 hours from Dubai to IAD was down graded from IAD to IAH because of over booking. I've learnt my lesson never again with United.,,,First Class,,1,2,1,1,2,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,K Smyth,United Kingdom,11/3/2014,"Having spent the last 7 weeks travelling around the world business class with various airlines we were very excited about our business first class flights firstly Honolulu to San Francisco and then Newark to Edinburgh on our journey home. The disappointment started with entry to the lounge on both occasions where no substantial food was offered. Carrots by the truck load and processed cheese on the tiniest crackers did not appeal so we had no option but to head back out to a food retailer for a sandwich at further expense (having spent £6000 on tickets already for this allegedly upgraded service). Liquid refreshments are limited with my husband being charged for a third drink when I had not even had one! It would appear that United Airlines Cabin Crew Bar Staff and Club reception staff attend regular classes in being curt disinterested or just plain rude! Thankfully waiting staff etc do not and are very pleasant. Regarding the plane itself on both occasions these were very obviously old and incredibly uncomfortable. Sitting in row 2 on both flights subjected we were subjected to cabin crew slamming doors continuously chatting very loudly or witness several members chomping on food whilst preparing the passengers meagre offerings. Please United Airlines take note of all these negative reviews you are offering a low budget service at a Premium price. Having looked around at the miserable faces (staff as well as passengers I might add!) in Newark lounge as I write this it says it all! We will we making as many friends and family aware of this and I'm guessing the others mentioned will too so I guess ""what goes around comes around"" eventually.",,,First Class,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

Jetstar was not good but I was really disappointed in United Airlines. Our United leg was a 6 hour flight from Newark NJ to LAX. I felt the seats were to close together. They give you water coffee or tea once. That is it. I'm so glad I had some snacks with me. You could buy something if you wanted. For a 6 hour flight they should give you something more. No nuts are anything extra. Really Oh if you wanted to watch a movie you had to pay for that too I will never fly with them again. This flight was booked by a travel agent.

This is apparently a converted Continental plane with full reclining seats in first class. The seat was very comfortable with plenty of room. The food was decent although the spinach calzone was drowned in a cream sauce - tasty but not very healthy. The servers were friendly and helpful although after the meal was served about an hour in you had to make a request for a beverage over the next 5 hours as opposed to any regular beverage service. I rarely fly first class so maybe they expect you to ask for something as opposed to bringing beverages out regularly? The plane had seatback on-demand entertainment which was great except why is it that the UA webpage is still showing their listings for September and October only?,,,First Class,,7,5,3,3,5,,,3,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Linda Sullivan,Australia,11/3/2014,"Recently travelled from Australia to US and back this included both international (SYD-LAX) and domestic (LAX-BOS) returning LAX-MEL was apprehensive as had read critical reviews however my experience was positive in all aspects. Found cabin staff both helpful and friendly helping passengers with difficulties in placing on board luggage this was more a problem on the domestic legs probably because people try to avoid checking in luggage and therefore push the limits with carry ons I note that some Aussie domestic airlines are cracking down on this so perhaps other airlines will follow.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,R Hall,United States,10/31/2014,"RT Kona Hawaii to London Heathrow. The flight from London to San Francisco is about 11 hours non-stop. I am a 6'3"" disabled and booked my flight with that disclosure. To accommodate me the agent made an effort to place me in a seat which had an empty seat beside me - very considerate and appreciated. At Heathrow prior to boarding I was called to the podium. To accommodate a family so that they might sit together I was told (not asked if I minded) I was being moved to a different seat and unbeknownst to me in a three-abreast row without an empty seat beside me. Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats. Years ago United was known as an airline that cared. It made for comfortable travel travel to which I looked forward. In summary in the future I will make a sincere effort to travel with an airline other than United.",,,Premium Economy,,1,1,1,2,4,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Michael Critchley,United States,10/31/2014,Since the late 80's I have been flying UA for business and pleasure and it has been a roller coaster ride. Having switched to another carrier for the last couple of years due to truly awful reliability and missing customer meetings I thought I would give UA another chance on a trip from Denver to Paris. How hard could it be? Get on the DEN-ORD flight allowing 2.5 hours in ORD to make the transfer to the ORD-CDG flight. The trip occurred 10 days after the control center fire and calls to UA customer service a couple of days prior to our trip confirmed things were working well again in ORD. The origin flight in DEN was the continuation of a SEA-DEN leg and that plane arrived right on time. The departure for ORD showed on time so we went to the gate to find another on time message on the board. Boarding time came and went with a last minute 15 minute delay. No problem I thought we had plenty of time in ORD. Soon another delay showed up on the gate monitor now we were 30 minutes late should I be worried? How much worse could it get and where was the Seattle aircraft that had made it to Denver on time? Soon another delay with the bottom line of just over an hour. Finally we boarded and pushed back and sat and sat and sat for another 15 minutes when a mechanical problem was announced. At this point it was clear we would miss the Paris connection and we went to the long lines at Customer Service to see what we could do. UA moved us to the later Lufthansa Frankfurt non-stop with CDG connection and said they would transfer our bags. (Of course no bags the next morning in CDG and UA blamed it on Lufthansa). Bags showed up 3 days later and we found out that UA sent them to ORD on a later flight. All this is very sad as the customer service people are trying hard to make their system work but are hamstrung by continued incompetent management. Once again we are riding the competition who are not perfect but much better than UA.,,,Economy,,1,2,4,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Anders Svensson,United States,10/28/2014,October 10 LIS-EWR. After arrival at our departure gate I thought I was at a wrong one after looking at the aircraft parked at the gate. To my astonishment I was about to make an 8-hour transcontinental flight on an ancient Boeing 737-200 whose regular use in domestic routes was phased out in 2008. United wouldn't be United without some kind of delay so there was a 30-minute hold. The flight was relatively smooth. Staff appeared to be seasoned but lacking courteousness with one having a condescending attitude and curt tone. Meals were hardly edible - I would say they were the worst of many kinds I have had. Overall I rate my experience with United below average and will try to avoid my future journeys with this airline.,,,Economy,,2,1,1,1,3,,,1,0

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,G Mishkevich,United States,10/28/2014,"We were traveling Business class from Newark to Las Vegas on Sept 26th. Apparently the definition of Business class offered by United differs from any other airline out there. When traveling economy I normally bring my own bottle of water and buy some food in the airport. This time given that I had paid 3 times as much for a Business class ticket and also remembering what it means worldwide I did not bring anything of my own. What a mistake! When I asked for a glass of water while plane was still boarding an extremely rude flight attendant asked me: ""Do you really want it now?"". Again United definition of a Business class does not include providing enough food for everyone. I have never encounter such unprofessional behavior in any service industry - and air travel belongs to a service industry last time I checked. In Business class provided by United you are paying for some extra leg room and nothing more. I will never fly this airline again.",,,Business Class,,1,4,1,1,3,,,1,0

The B744 to and from Hong Kong was clean and well-maintained but showing its age-especially in the lack of IFE. However in both directions the crews were very good with lots of passenger interaction and presence in the cabin. They were HK based and very international in composition. The crews to/from SGN were even better-old Continental Mic staff based in Guam. I had exit row seats on all legs and found the legroom to be fine and the seat OK--but on such long segments no seat in economy is really ""comfortable"". The food was OK-could have been better with just a few additional touches-but no real complaints.

No IFE supplied and no refreshments purchased but then again they are only short flights. But this time having booked our flights we were offered Economy Plus seats when we came to choose our seats for $28 each per flight. We duly chose this option and paid only for the aircraft on the outward flight to be changed. The replacement aircraft had no Economy Plus seats - no refund came until I chased this through there refund system. Worse still the return flight was on the original aircraft which never had Economy Plus seats in the first place.

About an hour before the landing the flight attendants came through with another beverage service. After they had passed I asked my row mates to let me out to use the rest room. The isle to the rear of the plane was blocked by the cart. I proceeded forward to the forward rest room where I was stopped by the male flight attendant serving first class. He indicated that I needed to return to coach and to the rear of the plane to use those restrooms. I indicated to him that the aisle was filled with the cart and the forward restroom was the only one I could get to. He again indicated to me to return to the rear of the plane. I told him I would not and proceeded by him and used the rest room. Behind me was my row mate (first met him on the plane) who is a 2014 1K member.

I was traveling to the states for Thanksgiving weekend and was delayed 3 hours on my first flight due to ""late inbound aircraft"" and again for my connecting flight another 2 hours due to the same reason. Looking back the last 4 times I have traveled with United this has been the reason. There was no weather leaving Montreal or Chicago. Then again on my return flight I was delayed 2.5 hours and 4 hours on my connecting flight. When I finally got to my final destination at 2 am after 12 hours of traveling which should have taken a total of 6 I waited 45 minutes for my checked luggage. When I asked why we were waiting for so long the United representative told me there were two flights coming in from Chicago and they wanted to put the luggage out all at the same time. I've never heard of this happening and several other passengers and I thought this was unreasonable. Our flight landed several hours late why should we have to wait even longer for another flight to land deplane and unload their baggage.

A journey I upgraded from economy to business first using a global premier upgrade a free perk obtained as a IK level frequent flyer.

They provided very professional prompt and friendly service. A comfortable seat in a new Boeing 787. In fact throughout all including my return journey from Rio via Houston and Chicago all check in and flight personnel were considerate and attentive. All flights arrived on schedule or early. I would also add that as a United flyer since 1995 my baggage has never been lost! From what I can see the only service problems this company ever had are being corrected.

Although mainland US airlines have a bad name for treatment of their passengers - the Micronesia service transcends this. There were a number of aspects about this flight which were worrying. At Cairns the demeanour of the check-in staff was very ""in your face"" - when we asked to speak to the supervisor - this only made things worse. Documentation is a ""very touchy"" aspect of booking in for any US airline these days. Even though we had our ESTA validation application in hard copy to show they basically refused to believe we had a valid ESTA as they were having trouble accessing the data on their computer. This was even though we had our ESTA forms identical to our passports! Take a hard copy of the website baggage guidelines - they make it up as they go! When we finally got in the air - the food is poor. Be prepared for some serious security scanning in Kwajalein as it is a closed airport unless you have a sponsor or travelling to Ebeye - Passport photocopied ESTA examined separate Sponsor documentation retinal scanning height weight finger printing and questioning.

United has gotten me back to and from in one piece but nothing from my 10 hour journey with them in a single day has been impressionable which brings me to conclude that perhaps that's all this airline is trying to achieve unlike some of its peers. Back and forth from Los Angeles to Austin I was able to get some rest and the buy on board food purchase wasn't half bad.

At the prices they charge even in this age of low expectations I was shocked at the experience of this trip. To begin with the aircraft used a 737 is just inappropriate for a five hour trip. The legroom was ridiculous for any class of service but unbelievable for a premium ticket. When the gentleman in front of me reclined his seat I had absolutely no space left. In coach one has come to expect this but not at these prices. I was one of two people judging from the upgrade list posted who paid full fare and that resulted in a full cabin. The flight attendants tried hard but United gave them nothing to work with. The breakfast served was small and awful there was only non fat milk for coffee and the food was inedible. The flight was timed to leave at 9.44 to avoid serving a more expensive lunch by one minute. The cost cutting is unbelievable the experience absolutely horrific to be avoided at any cost.

Flight from Toronto was inexplicably delayed. Upon arrival in Houston taxied to the gate only to find another plane at the assigned gate. Had to re-taxi to another gate arriving 5 minutes before scheduled departure to Rio de Janeiro. In spite of pleas from more than half the passengers regarding connecting flights flight attendants stated it was out of their control to deal with. Upon deplanning the Customer Service representative appeared over-whelmed with the situation and was of no assistance other than to direct all connecting passengers to the Customer Service Desk in Concourse C. The representative at the desk was of little assistance other than booking us on the next evening flight with non-adjacent seat assignments. Was not provided with the Premier Boarding package that I had booked and paid for in advance. We were told that we would not have access to our luggage and we were offered accommodations at a sub-par hotel chain which we declined. Also offered two $7 meal vouchers for a 24 hour period (which I also declined). Upon arrival the next evening gate staff were less than courteous. Certainly such delays occur when flying however the issue of not holding connecting flights when some 40 passengers are affected is not acceptable. This is especially true when arriving at or very near the scheduled departure time of the connecting flights and considering that such connection times are offered by the airline. Enhanced public relations by United staff would also go a long way in appeasing disgruntled passengers. That being said the regional jet from Toronto to Houston was new and very roomy. The premium economy seats on the B777 was also comfortable.,,,Premium Economy,,3,5,2,4,4,,,3,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Michael Rooney,United States,10/8/2014,Friday 26 Sep 2014 my wife and I went to BTV for what we thought were two legs of a flight on United Airlines that would get us into SFO at 12.40 PT. We actually arrived at approximately 02.30 PT on Saturday about 14 hours late. Part of the delay was caused by someone starting a fire in the FAA control tower at ORD. I have no complaints with United about that. My complaint with United is its total lack of communication on that Friday and on the return the following Friday. On the first leg from BTV to ORD United kept telling us we had to wait an hour. We could not leave we had to sit there with no information hour by hour from 07.00 to 16.00. The only thing we were told was our connections would be okay because they could not fly either. United even put us on the plane and pulled away from the gate at about 12.30. Then they brought us back to the gate and had us deplane and wait some more. Finally we left at about 16.00 and got to ORD expecting to get on the flight to SFO we were told was waiting. Imagine our surprise and anger to find the flight had left hours before. We were told we would have to stay the night in Chicago at our expense and leave in the morning! When I asked what about getting on the SFO flight the customer service person said it was fully booked and had a wait list. When I pushed the agent did put us on the wait list. One piece of luck we got on the plane. It was late enough that other people did not show. We spent the week in SFO and went to the airport in plenty of time. We had checked in for the return flight when we checked in for the outbound flight online. We went to the kiosk to check-in and there was no reservation. The agent at SFO was able to get us on the plane somehow so we relaxed again almost as much as we were when we went to the airport. Then she hit us with an unwarranted baggage charge. It was unwarranted because we used a United MileagePlus card for the flight. Despite realizing we had not been charged for the bags on the way out to SFO she would not believe us they should not be charged for. When we got to ORD we discovered our flight to BTV was not our originally scheduled 3 hour layover but an 8 hour layover. Again there was no communication from the SFO agent to us about changing our second leg it was just done. After a lot of talking we got onto our originally scheduled flight and got home on schedule.,,,Economy,,1,2,2,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Joseph,Canada,10/8/2014,We had a great experience with United Airlines on our return flight from Ottawa (Canada) to Phoenix connecting through Chicago O'Hare. Our flight to Phoenix was smooth and on time. The only thing missing was inflight entertainment. Our return flight was complicated by the fact that a disgruntled employee set a fire to a centre governing the flights through both Chicago airports on the Friday before our Sunday departure. We called the United 1-800 number and got through to an agent quite quickly. She was extremely helpful and could not find us an alternate flight with United so arranged for us to take a flight from Phoenix to Philadelphia and Philadelphia to Ottawa with US airways. We departed and arrived at a very similar flight to our original flight with United. This was the best service that I have ever received in a difficult situation like this. We had a very tight connection on the way back and our baggage arrived on the flight with us. Good job United!,,,Economy,,9,4,5,4,3,,,4,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,D Fuluvaka,United States,10/5/2014,Flew from Tucson AZ to Kona HI today. Horrible trip!. In Tucson the ticket agents argued and snapped at each other in front of the customers. The Tucson-LAX portion was fine the flight attendant was very professional and as I was traveling with a handicapped companion she was very helpful. The flight from LAX to Kona Hawaii however was awful. The flight attendants were rude short tempered and often ignored passengers questions. This was a five and a half hour flight to not even provide peanuts as a snack is ridiculous considering the cost of the food available for purchase. I will say the ground crew in Tucson LAX and Kona were fantastic and really went out of their way to help out. My issue is that the ground crew doesn't work for United and I didn't buy my ticket from them. United seriously need to work on their customer service relations!,,,Premium Economy,,1,2,1,1,2,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,C Tasker,New Zealand,10/5/2014,On a recent trip we flew 3 times with United. The first flight was on 9 September and we flew from Vancouver to Denver with a stopover en route to Albuquerque. These seats were all booked by a travel agent and confirmed 5 months prior to travel. On the first flight my husband and I were seated separately - I was seated behind my husband. We were given water and/or soft drink during the flight. The attendants were very brisk and almost rude in the 'service' they offered. But the flight did leave and arrive on time. The connecting flight however was not such a straight forward experience. When we went to the check-in we were informed by the staff that the flight had been over booked and that we at that stage were the over booked people. They did not apologise in fact they treated us very rudely. They spent the next hour and a half offering 2 passengers other flights hotel accommodation and $500 flight vouchers each in an effort to allow us to board the flight. Eventually and approximately 3 mins before the flight doors were to close after boarding and after I stood at the counter for around 10 mins they informed me that we could board. Again we were seated separately with my husband at the back of the plane and me sitting at the front. Never any apology. Our third flight was on the 13 September and we flew from Albuquerque to LAX in readiness for our flight back to Auckland NZ. The staff at the airport were again rude. Our flight left more or less on time and the flight staff were great bright and friendly. They actually appeared to be enjoying their job and treated the passengers with friendliness and courtesy. We actually managed to sit together on this flight.,,,Economy,,1,2,1,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,McCoy Mike,United States,10/5/2014,"I have the United app and I was checking on the situation in Chicago from the day before - was not told anything until I was stuck in the airport away from freedom when the agent told me the first leg into Chicago was delayed 2 hours and the 2nd leg from Chicago to San Diego had a connection I was not going to make because of the time I get in - it was the last flight out of Chicago for the night. The Agent was amazing and put me on another airline that would get me home to my family. Forever grateful! Once on the plane to Chicago the 1st class flight attendant was very attentive and extremely caring. When I asked if there were any snacks she said that the previous flight had depleted the stock. When I informed her about my birthday flights and the problems I was having she went all out. She offered me her own personal snack out of her purse with a smile. Selfless and sincere. She was a blessing to my day. As I left she handed me a ""care package"" of treats she was able to scrounge up on the plane for and offered me a happy birthday wish. She and the gate attendant both made my long hours and travel home to my family not just bearable but enjoyable.",,,First Class,,10,5,5,3,4,,,5,1

On the last flight as I was boarding I was informed that my seat had been moved. When booking the flight I paid extra to have an exit row aisle seat because I have bad knees and needed the extra leg room. I was instead placed in the middle seat of a non exit row. The staff made no explanation regarding my seat change did not offer their apologies and did not seem to have any concern over the money I had lost paying for a seat that I did not end up having. I am extremely frustrated with this service and will encourage all of my friends to fly with a different airline. This kind of treatment is unacceptable.,,,Economy,,3,1,3,3,1,,,2,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,R Foulkes,United States,10/5/2014,First class sure isn't what it used to be. On a round trip from Dulles to Vegas both times they ran out of cereal before they took my breakfast order so all they had to offer were some nasty eggs broccoli casserole and dried out croissants. Apparently they only stock enough cereal for 1/2 of first class? Really? For a $1378 ticket I want my freaking cereal not food poisoning. The clincher was that they charge first class passengers for wi-fi access. They should be ashamed. Only a half notch above economy if that much.,,,First Class,,3,2,2,1,3,,,2,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,K Kenneth,Singapore,10/5/2014,SYD-SFO-SYD: Flew in late September. I got the same plane for both legs of the journey which looks rather old. There appears to be more Economy Plus seats than Economy seats. Plane had a dodgy IFE for the entire section of seats I was seating. My own AVOD was jammed and could not be reset. Food was barely edible for dinner but it got better for breakfast and drinks were forthcoming. Legroom was okay. From the US leg I had to use the kiosk to check in but it refused to print my ticket and required a staff to assist me. I was disappointed with quality of the airline overall because I would have expected US-based airlines to have a superior standard. If you are flying on a budget this may be for you but otherwise you might want to look elsewhere.,,,Economy,,5,2,3,2,2,,,3,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Kearns,United States,10/5/2014,Our flight from Boston to Denver was delayed by an hour. We approached the service desk in Boston when notified about the delay because we had a very short layover on our way to Seattle. We were told all connecting flights would be fine and that they would make up the time in the air. It wasn't until we were almost to Denver that they bothered to inform us of the added time to the flight and we arrived just in time to see our next plane depart. They did put us up in a hotel for free and got us on the next flight out the next morning only to have that plane stop mid-takeoff due to a plane malfunction. If the staff had been gracious and accommodating during this nightmare it might not have been so bad but they had the nerve to tell us it was our fault for not having a longer layover (as if we had a choice).

The flight did what it said on the tin. However in my years of flying I've seen nothing like it! Onboard no crew at the door sat down and noticed people across from me put three large bags by their feet and then put tray tables down to cover them. Crew failed to spot this on a few occasions but eventually did ask 'can you put your tray table up' walked away before they seeing the bags. Crew served drinks by just looking at you no thank you no hello nothing! The flight had a free gift of cards given out - thrown at you of course.

Traveling with my sister we were left in Chicago 2am - no hotel - no luggage- no vouchers- just be back in morning for 8 am flight to Peoria.

One hour forty-five minutes after a smooth take-off they turned off the fasten seatbelt sign but then turned it back on four minutes later. A recorded message said ""Ladies and Gentlemen the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. Please make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened"". The flight attendants then repeated the message in English and Hebrew. This happened five more times during the 12 hour flight which made sleeping difficult. Breakfast was served one hour before landing and the flight attendants did a great job.

First off I am sitting in front of an exit row. I was never notified that my chair will not recline. Why did United notify me when I was selecting my seat? Next question why does United Airlines WiFi Beta not allow video streaming? GoGo WiFi works very well given the circumstances of being inflight when streaming videos. If you are going to force your passengers to use your WiFi please offer a superior solution than what currently exists or just use GoGo or another service that already does a great job. Why was I not notified that this brand new plane would not have TVs? I expected to have TVs in a brand new plane. If these new planes must have so many hours to be certified before TVs can be installed why do passengers not receive a discount on the flight and notified before purchasing the ticket? I feel like the staff the plane and the overall experience is geared to ""securing"" your safety which is great but every airline does that. Please don't use ""my safety"" as an excuse to give poor service. I can hop on a safe flight with any airline I want an airline who thinks of the small things that I mentioned above.

The fasten seatbelt sign had been on for five hours straight and passengers were told to prepare for landing. The plane was still at 36000 feet and there was still 40 minutes before landing. Within one minute the flight attendant was moving my seat to the landing position and said ""your not paying attention."" It doesn't take 40 minutes to prepare for a smooth landing.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Mordey Stephen,United Kingdom,9/22/2014,I've been a Mileage Plus member and a United frequent flyer since 1995. The programme can offer outstanding benefits if your travel needs match their network. I recently flew LHR to EZE via IAH. And this was fairly typical of my travels in recent years. I booked an itinerary in economy class and upgraded using miles and a cash fee. All flights were upgraded to business first well in advance of my departure. All flights offer lie flat seating. Sleeping for several hours on long haul sectors comes easily. Service is most often generous food is not luxurious but is well presented tasty and enjoyable. Particularly the fish dishes which are my first choice. Drinks are plentiful I love the cheese course rounded off with an ice cream sundae served to order. Followed by a liqueur and coffee. During UA958 from ORD to LHR on the morning of Sept 18th I awoke to discover that my passport had fallen from my pocket and was rested in an impossible to reach location beneath the structure of my seat. I requested some assistance from a flight attendant in the galley hoping that this might be offered after landing. The professional concerned simply picked up a flashlight and a large serving fork. The flight attendant lay flat on the floor and successfully retrieved my passport for me. All done with a smile and a great attitude. While criticisms often aired in forums such as this sometimes come with fair justification. On a good day and certainly with increasing frequency I find the level of service on board United Airlines to be improved and sometimes outstanding. I am a 1K and million mile flyer. I am confident that I will continue to be. There are some lovely people in the friendly skies!,,,Business Class,,8,4,4,3,3,,,4,1

Initially booked LAS-IAD and onward SN connection to BRU. Aircraft change on LAS-IAD led to being bumped onto LAS-ORD-IAD-BRU. Unworkable as ORD layover was only 50 minutes and my parents on separate ticket weren't bumped. Ultimately accepted change to LAS-ORD-AMS on UA metal but with upgrade to E+ for trouble which was appreciated. Tight layover of 75 minutes in ORD. Morning LAS-ORD flight delayed 60 minutes despite good weather across the country. UA agent offered next day's flight if we missed our connection I had to push hard and literally read out each flight number on alternative LH LX and UA flights. Agent was in the end helpful in taking my instructions protecting us on LH flight from ORD-FRA-AMS if flight was missed. Stress remained high; paid for Wifi on ORD to monitor situation. Arrival gate repeatedly changed adding to stress of possible connection success. All the while ORD-AMS flight delayed 40 minutes yet never appeared on UA website or advised by crew throughout LAS-ORD flight. Frantic disembarkment of flight and did not learn of delay until arrived at gate. Set aside improving its operation UA could avoid stress and hassle of employees and pax if it could at least learn how to communicate situations and update flight status's. Seatmate had experienced same mess the day before but unfortunately did have to wait 24 hours for the next UA flight to AMS. ORD-AMS an hour late though ironically great news for us. The infamous and ancient B763 Ghetto Bird window covered in sticky goo but led to free apology wine from FA after I called attention to it and personally cleaned it. Announcements in Dutch noticed and appreciated. Crew notably pleasant. Baggage made connection which was merciful. Food markedly worse than AC and European carriers.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Voss,United States,9/19/2014,As a Platinum customer I fly a lot with United and it is amazing how bad United has become over the last 5 years. Not only did they delay today's departure for a little bit of rain in DC and called it a thunderstorm but they also let our connection leave without us for our honeymoon. I am less frustrated when it is a business trip as I always expect that United does not make its connections. Last year I did not have a single flight on time and missed 6 flights. The business class had very uncomfortable seats the staff made the same announcement every 20 minutes for about 2 hours that we would be a little bit late. Then they made another announcement that someone would be waiting with information for us in Munich. All we were told at Munich airport was to go to the Lufthansa Service Center. The service agent sen us immediately to the departure gate but did not let the airplane know that there were multiple customers coming. So the plane left 5 minutes before we arrived at the gate after a wild goose chase through Munich airport. After flying for years and being vegetarian I usually bring my own food as I am over the monotonous and tasteless food they serve but today I flew business and I wanted some champagne and a meal. It is always the same and the quality of the food has gone downhill and the dessert has also not changed in the last 5 years. The purser came and apologized in person big deal however she did not have any information for those that got stranded in Munich.What about their new security video between images with kangaroos and people sitting in seats on the beach you get completely lost in their new bizarre security video. As an educator I can guarantee that not 1/3 of people have afterwards a clue of what was said because this looks more like a reality TV series or a bad infomercial. I have been to Africa Peru and Europe on three long flights and the movies between these directions do not change.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,S Andrews,United Kingdom,9/17/2014,On 21st August this year my wife and I were to fly United from Heathrow to Chicago and booked in early July. As soon as online check in opened I found that only five seats were left which meant that we were to be separated during the flight. How were all the rest allocated before the 24hr opening time? The night before we were due to fly out I received a text message to say that the flight was cancelled. Whilst on route to LHR a text arrived telling us to check in as normal. At the United desk we were told that we would be bussed to a hotel for the night. The best compensation they could offer was Economy Plus instead of our Economy seats. On the flight out the food was appalling. Drinks were served from jugs carried down the gangways in a very unprofessional style by very unprofessional stewardesses. After arrival at Chicago we thought our problems were over. Whilst in Washington we went to Dulles Airport to see a United Supervisor to ensure that we could sit together on the return flight on 11th September. The system would not allow her to print boarding cards with seat allocations more than 24hrs before departure but she printed some boarding cards and wrote the seat numbers on the cards. For the return journey we arrived in good time at Chicago checked in and boarded the aircraft on time to find that we had been given Economy Plus seats. Start up time came and went and then an announcement was made that an electrical fault existed. We waited eventually after a delay of approx. 1.5 hours we were off back to Blighty. The flight through the night was unpleasant due to the aircraft being very cold which made sleeping almost impossible. Altogether not a very good experience.,,,Premium Economy,,2,2,1,1,1,,,2,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Ronald Bryant,United States,9/14/2014,After two years of planning I thought I had all my ducks in a row for a trip from the USA to the Australia Zoo north of Brisbane. I even hired a Travel Agency to avoid any mistakes on my part. Boy was I mistaken. August 25 2014 was finally here. I went to my local airport two hours early (as instructed) and sat there for six hours at the United Airlines boarding gate. We were told the four hour delay was due to the weather in Chicago. Ok not a deal breaker since I had a scheduled six hour layover in Los Angeles. The ticket agent at my local airport is the only good thing about United. She kept track of my schedule and issued me a new ticket from Chicago to Los Angeles when it became obvious that I was going to miss my scheduled flight. I arrived in Chicago four hours late and promptly went to the United gate for my flight to Los Angeles only to to find out that it also was running four hours late. I found another United flight to Los Angeles and got a standby ticket. This flight was running three hours late. Finally I actually got to board a United Airline plane bound for Chicago. Now that all the passengers are onboard the pilot decides he needs to refuel. After maybe ten minutes he announces that the refuelling truck is broken and that the mechanics are working on it. So here we sat waiting to be refuelled. After maybe another hour the pilot announces he was going to taxi over to the international terminal to refuel. Well now it's very clear that I'm going to miss my connecting flight and I can't get off this plane. Fast forward - we arrived in Los Angeles at 2.30 am and my flight to Brisbane Australia left shortly after midnight. I asked the United employee at the gate how to get to the other terminal and she bluntly said the airport was basically closed until 4 am and said I could sleep on the plastic chairs until then. I can't blame anyone for weather delays but the refueling fiasco in Chicago is unacceptable. The rude United employees are unacceptable.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Patricia Knott,United States,9/14/2014,PDX to MRY round trip Sept 3rd and 10th via San Francisco and via LA. They have consistently delayed flights to/from MRY because they cannot find a plane. On September 3rd they changed gates twice making it difficult for a senior to get to. Today September 10th they are delaying again for the same reason. This means that I'll miss my LA connection because this flight will arrive after the plane leaves that airport. I'm going back to Alaska they can schedule planes to flights.,,,Premium Economy,,1,5,5,1,1,,,4,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,S Rabin,United States,9/14/2014,LHR-SFO. Connecting to this flight from Brussels on Brussels Airlines maybe 4 or 5 folks on this flight going to the SFO flight. Brussels flight late connecting time tight for LHR (scheduled for 70 minutes more like 25 with the late flight and you have to go through security to get to US). Brussels Airlines has not transferred to Star Alliance Terminal 2 yet where United lives so we had a mad dash across from Terminal 1. Got to gate after going through security-one of the agents said don't worry they were holding the flight a few minutes for us. (That's good service). As usual the flight attendants on UA were generally friendly and polite but are not formal like the European or Asian airlines which is fine with me. Food reasonably good; had a chicken dish for lunch that was quite tasty actually. Overall a nice easy flight after working up a sweat running to the gate.,,,Business Class,,8,4,4,4,4,,,3,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,K Hose,United Kingdom,9/14/2014,I have to say I was extremely hesitant after reading the reviews on this site and due to fly with UA on 22nd August 2014. I had 5 flights covering a 3 week period and flew from Glasgow - Newark- Las Vegas - San Fran - San Diego back to Newark - Glasgow and was totally happy with the service provided to my family and I. We experienced no delays the cabin crew couldn't have been nicer and the pilots seemed to go out their way to improve passenger comfort. The seating within the plane was large enough in economy and the in flight entertainment was excellent during the international flight to and from Glasgow. All in all I have no issues with any of the flights delays happen and when they do you have to deal with them its a part of every day travel and I'm sure every airline experiences them. Will definitely be recommending UA to anyone who asks.,,,Economy,,7,5,5,4,5,,,5,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,L Spencer,United Kingdom,9/14/2014,Just returned from USA flying both ways with United. 3rd flight this year flying with United to SFO connecting to ACV (Eureka). United is the only commercial airline flying into ACV. Food is never that great but that's pretty much the norm with most airlines I guess. Inflight entertainment is perfect with personal screens (777 aircraft if flying 747 then just multi screen). I am a silver mileage plus member so currently gain access to economy plus free of charge which is a bonus along with the extra benefits of being a silver mileage plus member. Outbound flight on time three seats to stretch out across which was great. Returning from SFO to LHR all crew London based. The service from the Base crew was the worst I have experienced from any cabin crew. I've even flown US Airways a couple of times in the past and anyone who has flow US Airways will know how scratchy their service is but even US Airways cabin crew offered better service than what I witnessed from the London base crew with United. Crew looked like they didn't want to be there drinks service only twice for a 10 hour flight food awful. Breakfast just a croissant and a couple of chunks of melon why even bother. Maybe United should send out WYR surveys to passengers and that way they would get a broad idea of a customers experience. However I'm not flying with United for cheap smiles and attractive cabin crew and 1st class service what I am flying with United for is airline miles premier service with mileage plus and an airline that can get me to my final destination the rest is just extra.,,,Premium Economy,,7,3,2,2,5,,,5,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,K Chai,Malaysia,9/10/2014,I took a flight from Shanghai to SFO and onward to LAS. On the return trip from LAS to SFO and then to Hong Kong. 1) Old planes - the planes are so old you don't even get your own personal TV. I remember flying in the 1990s to be just like that when inflight entertainment runs over the large monitor in the front. How is anyone near those screens ever going to sleep on the long flights? 2) Food just is bad. You need to pay for alcoholic drinks. Really? You can't price that into the ticket? 3) Check in at LAS is a nightmare. The auto check-in machines don't really work and require a lot of manual intervention from the staff but there's probably 2 staff serving about 2 dozen machines. 4) Seats are bad.,,,Economy,,1,1,2,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,L Altman,United States,9/10/2014,If I could give United Airlines 0 stars I would. United is a horrible airline with awful customer service unreliable departures dirty airplanes and rude stewards. I booked my ticket 6 months in advance and was bumped to a different later flight about a month prior to my trip. I called the airline and was able to be placed on my original flight. The customer service representative offered no sensical explanation as to why I got bumped. I wanted to ensure I would not be charged for their mistake. The representative assured me I would not be. Well that was not the case. On the day of my flight I found out I had double reservations for two different flights and was charged twice. I immediately called customer service to rectify the situation. I was on the phone for over an hour and the situation was handled horribly. I am beyond disappointed and disgusted with their lack of professionalism. As frequent traveler for both personal and professional purposes I will never fly United again.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

Delta offered complimentary TV and snacks more leg room and I didn't feel as if I was sitting on my neighbors lap.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Constance Marshall,United States,9/10/2014,After flying from Sacramento to Dulles airport in Washington and then on to Frankfurt it was apparent why United ranks at or near the bottom in the airline ratings. The Airbus 320 to Washington a 5+ Hour flight was brutal. There is no leg room at all the seats are flimsy and uncomfortable and it's impossible to recline your seat because of cramped space. It should be unlawful to pack that many people into limited space. The flight attendants were tired surly and unfriendly. We were in Economy but a row of seats right in front of us were Economy Plus they were empty on our flight. My husband needed to use the bathroom so I sat down in one of the Economy Plus seats until he finished so I could stretch my legs. An FA quickly came over and informed me I couldn't sit there. I told her I was waiting for my husband etc. She said rudely that I needed to return to my assigned seat. There were many empty seats on this flight but when people tried to spread out to get more room they were told no. One man asked if he could sit in one of those seats and was told no because they were Economy Plus. I don't get this attitude. The food was horrendous! There was no food service on the Sacramento to Washington flight which is inexcusable on that long of a flight. Aegean Air from Istanbul to Frankfurt a 55 minute flight served a hot meal - at midnight! There's something wrong with this picture. On the Washington to Frankfurt flight we were served something called a crostini. It had processed lunch meat and processed cheese. It was so horrible I couldn't eat it. Airline food has never been great but it's reached a new low. United should be ashamed of their service. We won't fly with them again.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Seah Wy,Singapore,9/10/2014,"I travelled from Singapore to San Francisco only because it was a codeshare flight with ANA (from which I booked my tickets). Inflight entertainment was decent on the 1st leg of the flight to Tokyo presumably because it has just been upgraded with touch screen high resolution screens. However inflight service was horrid if you would even call it service to begin with. Flight attendant lashed out when I returned my tray (I was back from the restroom returning to my seat and thought it would be convenient for us both if I were to hand the tray to him since he was collecting the trays 2 rows before mine). ""Can you please wait"" with absolute annoyance and utter look of disdain before grudgingly snatching the tray away. The same flight attendant stepped on a pillow (which fell from a passenger's seat) while pulling the trolley and conveniently kicked it aside to the bottom of the passenger seat without a bat of his eyelid. On the food expect the same food you'll get from a low cost carrier. In fact you'll be better off with just cup noodles. It was the first time I have seen attendants hand out food without giving you the option to choose simply because ""we ran out of xx option so this is your only choice"". Inflight service was scarce no one bothered serving water after the meals and before flight landed. On the 2nd leg from Tokyo to SF there was a huge screen in front which they call inflight entertainment. You have the option to pay a nominal sum for wifi access and watch the movies from your own smart devices. Food was as poor as it can get for an international airline with poor service all the same. Rude attendants were still present but I was spared from any lashings this time round (the lady in front got reprimanded for the most ridiculous reason). I asked if I could make an inflight purchase 4 hrs before the flight was scheduled to land and was told the attendant in charge was resting. 2 hrs later I asked the same question and the same answer was given. Just when I decided I am not going to let United earn another cent from me that flight attendant finally finished her break right before the plane commenced its descent and asked what I would like to get. Do note that the ratings were made when comparing against the inflight experience I had when I took Cathay Pacific and ANA flights from Singapore to SF earlier this year and last year.",,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

The nightmare began when we noticed that we (as two friends travelling together) had been assigned seats that were not located next to each other. But we were okay with this. The flight attendants were pretty friendly but drinks were only served 2 times and food was not served at all (on a 5.5 hours flight). There was the option to purchase food but in my opinion it should go without saying that complementary food is offered on a long-distance flight. Onboard entertainment was also not available for free. Furthermore the TV screens could not be turned off so we were exposed to continuing advertising which lasted the whole flight. When we finally reached our destination in San Diego we were tired starving and thirsty.,,,Economy,,3,1,2,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Allan Sweetser,Canada,9/6/2014,Flight UA3789 August 27 2014. Boarded an almost new plane that was in pristine condition comfortable seats (travelling on miles and paid for upgrade to premium seating). Ready for a great flight left on time. The flight crew were terrible there were glares from the front of the plane to the back. Almost no eye contact with customers rude finger pointing. When the snack trolley came by they simply walked past directed their comments to the air in front of them and continued on - likely very few sales there! When coffee and drinks came by they were already past before we could even request a drink (we weren't really asked you see) and we had to call them back to get a coffee. When I went to the toilet the crew simply jerked their finger at me without saying anything and gestured me into a seat that was vacant to wait. They scowled at everyone. By the time we left the plane the people in the seats behind me across from me and the seats near the toilets (I heard them talking as well) were totally turned off by our crew. This was the fourth bad experience I have heard of with United in the past year from co-workers and friends. In fact I have as yet to hear a good experience from any of my colleagues. Also when deplaning they gave out erroneous information. They said that those with connecting flights would have their luggage forwarded and they did not need to collect it. It was wrong in that they do need to collect their luggage to go through customs. Fortunately customs officials were asking people to make sure they had their forwarded luggage. Terrible service.

Line up through security was long and slow due to only one lane being open (obviously not United's fault but still frustrating). United flight to and from Winnipeg are seldom on time and either delayed or cancelled probably about 70% of the time. It was no surprise to me that it was delayed an hour and a half. Ended up landing in Chicago about 2 hours late. On the way home mobile check in worked and the whole experience was positive. Got to the gate and seeing my flight was on time was too good to be true and it was. It moved gates and was delayed 40 minutes. Both flights were on an E145. I knew it was going to be snug so I can't really complain since I knew what I was flying on. Both flight attendants were pleasant.

The club in LA is just abysmal with the lack of any proper amenities. My recent fight from Los Angeles to Seattle experienced an hour delay and there wasn't any proper dine for sale option though the flights departure was around dinner time.

As well as the staff being incredibly surly I was amazed that they chose to serve a chicken dinner at 10.30am in the morning!

I am a small women in my 60's. United's seat size just fits me. I was in a window seat when a medium-large gentleman a little round around the edges sat next to me. This man was not obese. He overflowed his seat enough that every time he moved we were shuffled together from butt to knee. I put up with it for half an hour and then excused myself to the aisle. I paced in the back of the plane for an hour. The attendants were serving whatever they serve and saw that I was near hysteria at the thought of returning to what awaited me in my assigned seat. They did find a solution eventually. A United employee was flying coach and they switched me out with him. But the new seat was only 3 rows in front of the gentleman who had been next to me and he had to watch this seat change knowing his size overlapping mine was the cause. These conditions are set up by United in planning an aircraft with seats that are way smaller than the human population of these times. They know this and leave it to their flight attendants to deal. Other airline carriers are tight too but I have heard and witnessed that United is the worst.,,,Economy,,1,1,4,1,1,,,3,0

New lounge at SFO is still pretty bad considering it's a UA hub and supposed to represent the USA to the Pacific Rim but it was adequate (although be warned the bar closes at 10.30pm sharp not so good for those of us on midnight flights). Food on 1 flight also not so great (overdone tasteless steak) but otherwise good - I think they serve starbucks coffee because it tasted so burnt I could only drink 1/3 cup even though we were going on 30+ hours with no sleep by the time we were landing in Costa Rica.

We got a flight for the 21st August which involved a couple of stops. The flight was from Birmingham UK stopping at Newark NJ and then at Washington Dulles then Syracuse (outgoing). First the flight was supposed to leave Birmingham at 09.00hrs that left 3 hrs late due to technical trouble. Got to Newark NJ so late we missed the 14.50 connection to Washington Dulles. They then booked us on another flight from Newark to Syracuse that was leaving at 21.04hrs that never turned up until about 22.30 and because there was a little downpour of rain the flight was delayed it had never left Attica. We went out on to the tarmac to board the plane and was confronted with a plane that looked like something from the Fred Flinstone era. This was a tiny DHC8 turbo prop plane and we were buffeted around like a roller coaster. So for that trip we were delayed for about 12 hours. Not even a cup of tea or a glass of water was offered to the passengers. The way back was even worse we were supposed to leave Syracuse at 19.10hrs on the 2nd September 2014. Next thing you know the rain started to fall again flight cancelled for 24 hours. We had to spend our own money for a one night stay in a hotel.

We had a connection to NRT with ANA and our reservation had some issues but it was efficiently solved by the staff and our luggage was directly tagged to NRT avoiding luggage fees despite being on two separate reservations. Flight was ahead of schedule both departure and arrival. Service on United has always been warm friendly and efficient. I'm a big fan of their service and never had an issue. While they are not as polished as most Asian carriers are they are interactive with the passengers and their service makes you feel at home. BOB options were extensive and quality was excellent. They also did frequent beverage runs despite only being a 6-hour flight. IFE system is wonderful the movie choices were great and most of which are recent Hollywood movies.

The staff were very unwelcoming. My seat was behind the exit row which was empty - all the row was empty and seeing as I was sitting between a family who had been split up because of the shoddy seating arrangements we asked if we were able to use the exit row. The response (in an aggressive tone) was no! If you want to sit there its now been designated premium economy its an extra USD 170 each and you can pay by credit card! Note that this in the economy / coach section. The stewardess then made a big deal of slamming down all the dining trays on those seats as if to ""seal off the section"" - it all made for an incredibly unpleasant start to the flight. Aside from the small seats and lack of leg room when dinner came round I politely requested a cup of tea. The cup of tea was passed to me without any milk or sugar. I politely asked for milk and sugar. She stopped - glared at me and snapped - ""well you could have told me that when you asked for the tea"". By this stage me and the family I was sharing the row with were finding the staff so rude it was verging on comical. Then to top it off having spent thousands of dollars on this flight I learn that there is no free alcohol. Don't get me wrong I can go with out a drink for 16 hours but its a small touch to offer an alcoholic beverage as part of the service.

We purchased Economy tickets from NRT-IAH-FLL-SCE-IAD-NRT but I later upgraded to BusinessFirst with cash. The cash upgrade cost $1400 each. On the NRT-IAH leg the first thing that I found odd was that the FA literally threw the tablecloth to/at me at the beginning of dinner service. I think he just didn't care because throughout the flight his demeanor was cold. Small things like my wife's request for water without ice were met with the glass of water with the biggest piece of ice in it. The seat was great the food was about what you'd expect at a family restaurant and I'm ok with both of these things but I really had to wonder don't people who pay to fly premium deserve at least not passive-aggressive”service? I guess not. The NRT- IAH departure was an hour late due to weather. We were not able to make our connection at IAH. I bet United Airlines could have helped expedite passengers (through immigration/customs/re-checking) with tight connections. Our IAH-FLL departed while we were waiting for our bags. I informed the UA rep at the baggage claim and he told me they'd rebooked us on the next mornings 06.40 IAH-FLL. I asked if I could get a meal/hotel voucher but he informed me that since it was a weather delay UA couldn't take care of us. We feared that we might oversleep the 06.40 flight because of the jetlag. I called UA to ask for another booking and though there were 4 IAH-FLL flights that day our only options were 06.40 or 20.00 departure. Their website revealed open seats on all flights but the rep explained to me that those were first class seats and we weren't eligible for them. The weather delay on departure was caused by a typhoon. IAH is also known to be quite poor at handling international flights. UA made the decision to sell NRT-IAH tickets with a 1.5-hour buffer nonetheless. Maybe it's my fault for buying it but at any rate rather than stay up all night or lose yet another day with my family we accepted a better-timed flight to MIA. Our business with UA resumed two weeks later for the SCE-IAD-NRT return to Japan we took another carrier for our FLL-MBJ and MBJ-ATL-DTW-SCE trips. I mistakenly placed a bottle of honey in my carry-on which was picked up by TSA at security. I figured that if I couldn't get to my bags I could box and check it. I saw my bags were already gone so I waited at the side of the check-in line and figured I would wait until they announced last call for SCE-IAD. The desk rep soon did so and I politely explained “I'd like to get this in to my checked bags.” The man was the portrait of hypertension and stress. He acted as if the world were about to end. Eventually another rep nicely asked me to go get a box from the store across the hallway and I did and when I came back the stressed-out rep acquiesced and while printing the tape/tags repeated over and over “ The flights boarding/you've got to get on it/it’s leaving.”The flight was just starting to board. I am writing this onboard IAD-NRT. We've decided that we won't fly UA again. We’ll pay more to avoid it.,,,Business Class,,2,4,1,2,2,,,2,0

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Joel Henderson,United States,8/28/2014,"My two children and I had a flight booked from Albany to Portland Oregon changing planes in Newark and Houston. I received my first delay notice via email at 10.16 due to late inbound aircraft arrival. The second one came at 4.39 pm while we were at Newark Airport due to same reason however my children and I watched the plane arrive. The plane had tons of cargo underneath. Not just baggage but tons of commercial boxes. Our plane which was originally supposed to take off at 5pm for Houston did not take off until almost 7pm which put us in Houston at 9.30 a half hour after our plane left for Portland. That was just the beginning of our frustration. As I got to the gate and went to ask the United Airline attendant about connections she said ""see the guy down there and he will help you with connecting flight."" She was just telling us what we needed to hear to get us out of her way. By the time I got to customer service at 9.45 United Airlines customer service workers were dropping like flies among a mob of very unhappy people. We are talking 10pm people at one of America's busiest airports. 10.30 I finally get with a customer service worker who gets me food voucher's taxi voucher's and a hotel voucher for a best western 25 minutes away from the airport. She said ""grab some food around the corner"". All food venues were closed. We walked down to ground transportation and were informed only yellow cabs accept taxi voucher's. Finally got a cab and made it to the hotel at 11.30. In short lies and terrible customer service. The cargo was more important than the passengers and the customer service was horrible. I guess I'll never fly United again and given the amount I travel that's a loss for them.",,,Economy,,1,3,1,1,1,,,1,0

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Matthew Blackett,United Kingdom,8/28/2014,TPA-ORD-LHR: terrible. I know you get what you pay for but I still expect more than this for what was mainly a transatlantic trip. The TPA-ORD leg was the usual 'bus' service you get used to for US domestic trips but the international leg was beyond terrible. The aircraft was old - decor of a bygone era. The TV screens were the sort I remember for a decade ago - tiny no personal controls. The food was stingy and poor quality (a slab of meat resembling a chicken breast at some time in the past). The cabin crew were surly and long past retirement age (who knows what would happen in an emergency). Surely they could stump up at least one complementary alcoholic beverage like other transatlantic carriers. Next time I'll pay more for a much superior service.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,AJ Bolton,United States,8/28/2014,Paid high premium for last minute flight. Wasn't given a seat assignment because no coach seats were left and only seats toward the front which they charge $84 to sit in were left. Got seat assignment at gate back of the plane. Received lowest Group Boarding number because the gate agent said they order group number based on where you sit. Windows higher middle lower aisle lowest. But if you fly stand by you get to set in premium seats with better group number getting a better chance to have overhead space because no one wants to pay $84 just to sit closer to the front of the plane which gives you a better group number. Other airlines are based on more you pay more you get. Was already paying max for flight way more than rest because time constraints than other passengers.

They were very short with passengers! The over head bins were full and they asked that stored our bags under the seats in front of us. I am 6' 2"" the new planes have even less room to fit your legs and feet. Once you bag goes there where are you to put your feet and legs? Keep in mind all I had was a computer bag. I was sitting mid plane in an aisle seat I asked if there was any room up further for my computer bag - ""No if you don't like it the next flight in 3 hrs is less full if you would like me to arrange it for you"". This was the reply in a very threatening tone! A few moments later I watched the same scenario happen to 2 more passengers with the same consequences. Very unprofessional atmosphere!

When I entered the aircraft I was immediately asked what beverage I would like as well as providing hot towels. The crew were very nice and gave us hand written Thank You notes for my business. The food was better than I expected it to be. They served so many appetizers before the main course that I was full. I was so surprised when they asked if I would like ice cream and customized it with toppings right in front of me! If you were hungry between meals there is a walk up bar that has fruits snacks wraps desserts etc. The IFE had a huge screen and had all the newest Hollywood blockbusters tv shows music and games. The seats were really comfortable as they had the option to put them 180 degrees so that you can sleep (the armrests automatically go down as the bed reclines) and can sleep comfortably for a tall person. They also had plenty of plugs that accepts USA and other countries plugs. The seats have plenty of storage however found it odd that flight attendants won't allow you to stow things under your seat. I slept right after the Meal service and was woken up just in time for breakfast. I couldn't believe that I could actually get sleep on a plane!

This review is about my last flight in August 14. I was flying from Houston Texas to LAX. There was a storm near Texas and we were delayed about 2 hours. I understand there are natural disasters out of the airlines control. The problem is how these situations are handled. First one of the flight attendants seemed annoyed by people asking if they could use the restroom and get some water. The other flight attendant was very nice and she tried her best to accommodate peoples needs. Once we were in the air they started selling food to people about an hour into the flight. I have a gluten free restriction and they had very limited options. I wanted the cheese plate with grapes and chocolate and they sold out! That was pretty much my only option. Finally we arrived to LAX 2+ hours late and the gate didn't work. So we waited once again to be let out. Finally it was time to go get my luggage which was taken from me in Texas because there was no more room for my bag. I was the last one on the flight because they had a computer glitch and they couldn't find my seat. It took them about 20 minutes to fix the problem. They didn't tell me if I should wait by the door or go to baggage claims once I arrive at LAX. Once I arrived at LAX I tried asking about my luggage but there was big lines to talk to someone. There seem to be many other problems last night. Finally I asked one United flight attendant and with an attitude she told to go to baggage claim. I told her nobody had explained to me where to get my bag and she was annoyed with my questions. I had flown in other airlines were my luggage was given to me once I exited the plane! It was a legitimate question. Once I was in baggage claim they had about 5 different places two pick up luggage. 3 out of the 5 screens was broken. I asked another Inited employee where I could get my luggage and again with an attitude she said ""Obviously it's right there can't you see it?"". I told her their screens are broken so no I can't see it. Most United Airline employees are rude disrespectful and not helpful. They seem to hate their job.

Today he is supposed to come back from Austin but his flight is delayed due to technical difficulties for 5 hours and instead of taking care of my son as I have paid them to do so I they instead have called my son's aunt whom my son was living with in Austin and asked her to come and wait with my son for the duration of the time. We are wondering why we have paid this fee and what it even includes. When his aunt went to tell the the airline service that my son has the unaccompanied minor service they told her that they don't care and that she must wait in the line like everyone else. This is horrible service and is terrible compared to other airlines. I will not be flying with United Airlines after this experience.",,,First Class,,1,1,1,3,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Grundy Vanessa,Canada,8/8/2014,"We flew home from Germany to Alberta Canada we had a stop over in Chicago IL. United Airlines had the worst service we have ever had from an airline company. The people were very unhelpful. Here is what happened an explanation of why we are so disappointed. The customer service was the worst we have had. It was our honeymoon we boarded our initial flight in Barcelona Spain with a different airline they flew us to Germany at which point we were to get on our UA flight. The first thing that annoyed us was that the UA airline baggage people didn't even make an effort to get our luggage on our first UA flight (this is something we didn't find out until we were already in Chicago). The lady we spoke to in Chicago simply said ""you had a short layover and in cases like that we don't get the luggage because its too difficult."" Once we were in Chicago and realized our baggage hadn't made it onto our plane we were told that it would be very easy to give the UA baggage office our address and they would ship them to us the next day. So we landed in Calgary (an hour late) and went to the UA baggage office to report our missing bags and give our address to them. We waited at their office for 1.5 hrs. This was a very frustrating experience in regards to the baggage and customer service. On a final note I would not recommend traveling with United Airlines (Lufthansa)!",,,Economy,,1,1,1,3,3,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Filsone Tony,United States,8/8/2014,United Airlines business or first class to Aruba is very bad. Misleading advertising service and claimed equipment is false. No inflight entertainment as advertised. No video or music in First Class. Seats tray and pockets all dirty with food and garbage from last passenger. This was a brand new plane and in first class the seats were so close I could not get out of my seat without disturbing the passenger in front of me or to my side. Food was spoiled with rancid oil used. Staff could care less. Not even power for my laptop to get work done. Wi-Fi entertainment power all advertised and paid for but got none of it.

All was chargeable but water. Never experienced it before with a major airline. 2) Houston-Munich: Firstly our initial flight was cancelled after a 4 hours wait. Ground staff overwhelmed. We waited 2 hours more for rebooking on next day flight they lodged us for overnight in a poor hotel. When finally we took the next days flight crew on board were unpleasant neither a smile nor a ""thank you"" especially for the offloaded passenger of the previous day.

It happens the planes were switched but the very blatant tension selection of those who got left behind was very frustrating. The customers left behind had booked their flight well in advance and there seemed to be a consistent trait we were connectors from SF. The question of whether I was in for an adventure aka a delayed flight to a completely different location was condescending. No apology until I dealt with a woman at the end of the process. She treated the situation with sensitivity and realized that as a traveler and customer this could possibly be stressful and frustrating.

I am only 5' 2"" and 105 lbs. and I was unable to sit without my knees hitting the seat in front of me. There was no in-flight entertainment at all. I will continue to avoid flying UA at all costs even though they have a hub near us in SFO.

This time around the flight staff were rude or off-handish. One flight attendant abruptly placed the food tray stating 'only chicken' when another flight attendant actually had pasta. When questioned we were spoken to rudely. The toilets were not cleaned on other airlines they clean as you go. My wife mentioned to the flight attendants and their reply was 'you should see the rest of China' - we actually live in Beijing. They also said that she should wait until Beijing when it will be cleaned. Also in years past (18 years I have been flying with UAL) United had been much better.

After much difficulty finding a number for the airline was able to get a different flight however leaving Aug 6th instead of 5th.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Analise Fagan,United States,8/8/2014,I booked a straight flight from Washington Dulles to Toronto CA. Keep in mind that this was a weekend trip and I was supposed to return Monday afternoon. My departing flight was scheduled for 3.20pm and we boarded around 4pm. The pilot announced that the door could not close completely so we had to wait for an Engineer to fix it. We waited on the plane for an hour. The Engineer came and it took an additional 30 minutes. We got on the runway then the pilot announced that Toronto had issued a no-fly restriction due to severe thunderstorms. We waited on the runway for an hour. They took us back to the terminal and after about 2 0minutes it was time to take off again. We got back on the runway went to the same spot to prepare for take-off when the pilot announced that Toronto Intl. issued another no-fly restriction and we had to wait 30 more minutes. So we did. Then later they called the plane off the runway and cancelled the flight. It took 2 hours to get to customer service so they could help me get on another flight. The Agents were so rude and barely attempted to help me find something that would take me to Toronto that night! Ended up booking me on a 5.45am flight Saturday morning. I left Washington Airport at 11pm. Saturday morning I got on a connecting flight through Texas. What was supposed to be a straight flight to Toronto took 6 hours! To make matters worse my new booking was out of Reagan Airport so I had to adjust my return flight. They gave me a flight back on Air Canada (the Toronto to Chicago leg). I stood in line to check in and learned from the agent at Air Canada that United never officially reserved the seat for me. I had to run to United get them to reserve the flight give me a print out so that I could return to Air Canada. I connected in Chicago. The United flight from Chicago to DC was hour late.

The girl at the desk just seemed so unimpressed and was very cold towards my family and I. Upon going through customs it was very disorganized and very little help was offered while at the receipt kiosks. While going through baggage check the man checking our carry ons was telling everyone that passed that our flight was cancelled. Mind you the smartphone app said the flight was on time early actually. We then got into the waiting area there was just a sense of panic going on and nobody knew what was going on. A flight attendant came and confirmed it was cancelled. Maybe 10 minutes went by and another flight attendant came by and said it was in fact running on time and not to worry.

The flight LAX/IAH was particularly good - the crew were amazing. The last flight IAH-GIG was superior - the 772 was much newer than the one used on the SYD-LAX route and crew did not disappear for hours in the middle of the flight.

While I have had my share of grumpy UAL flight attendants I immediately noticed a different energy in the FC cabin when I entered (I bought FC - it was not a complimentary upgrade). There were two male flight attendants being warm and welcoming. They were constantly seeing what passengers needed (it was a 24 seat 757). They knew how to handle every request and not just with a sterile perfunctory smile. The mood among all of the passengers was noticeably different. I'm not sure that many of UAL's FA's know how significant they are in creating an energy on the plane among the people by the way they welcome and serve the passengers. Most FA's know how to serve a cup of water. That does not take much skill. However to serve the water and give the sense that it is done graciously is something else.,,,First Class,,10,3,5,3,1,,,4,1

Initial impressions of United were not great as I attempted to check in online only to find that their website system 'could not check you in at this time' after going through the whole process! United now operate from the new terminal 2 at Heathrow which is a big improvement. However upon boarding it was noticeable that the 767 was quite old (pre Boeing 'signature interior' and my seat was uncomfortable. The IFE system is also outdated and was unreliable. However the flight was punctual. The check in system for my return flight ORD-LHR was poor. Initial check in at the airport required using an automated terminal but I could not select a seat as these are allocated at the gate. It is then necessary to queue again to be allocated a seat. There is also not enough space in the departure area to accommodate everyone travelling on the flight. The onboard conditions were also similar on the return flight to the outbound (same aircraft type) except that I was bumped down into the standard economy section from the Economy Plus section. As someone who is 6ft plus this meant squeezing into a cramped seat with minimal legroom - totally unsuitable for a lengthy flight. In addition they ran out of meal choices so passengers had to 'get what they are given'. United also have a stingy policy of charging for alcoholic drinks at inflated prices. Once again the seat was not comfortable and the IFE system was not even working this time. Thankfully arrival was slightly early and the arrival process at Heathrow was most efficient.

I was then left stranded as an international passenger trying to deal with a very surly United ground staff ""customer service agent"" who told me either to sleep overnight in the airport or find a hotel? No help or assistance. I complained to United officially on my return to the UK and in fact they ""granted"" me a voucher for $150 off my next booking. They added that they hoped that this did not give me a bad impression of United. Unfortunately I had already made my next booking to the US with United travelling Belfast to Newark to Knoxville early July. Flights from Newark to Knoxville cancelled two days in a row. As there are 3 of us this time I have to find hotels for 2 nights in a row. One positive that came of this was that United re-routed us to Knoxville via Atlanta using Delta. On the way back from Knoxville via Washington to Newark the United flight was delayed by 2 hours. We are then re-routed from Washington to London then Belfast. It maybe incidental to note that no other airlines had delays at Knoxville that day? At least we get home albeit some 4 hours later than expected.

She refused pointing out that I was on backup for 10.10 pm with United. She reissued my ticket on American at the coach rate. She also incorrectly copied down the gate to delay my progress. Thankfully they were on the same concourse. When I made it to American I indeed confirmed that there still was an open first class ticket. The lovely American agent called United and unfortunately did no better than I had for the past three hours finding someone who could reissue the ticket as first class.

While the seats are more-or-less simulated business class and the entertainment selection is quite good the service quality is the worst in my 35 year experience. The ""flight attendants"" apparently come to work only to qualify for free travel as they most certainly do not go out of their way to provide anything approaching ""service"". The meals and drinks were delivered with all of the passion one expects when one of these veterans delivers the FAA pre-flight announcements. I despised making any contribution to wages these people did not earn. Given a choice between United and Aeroflot I'll likely choose Aeroflot. I fly 10-12 times per year and make the Asia flight 406 times annually this round trip is the worst I've had in 35 years of travel. My advice: fly anyone but United.",,,Business Class,,1,2,1,1,4,,,2,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,M Nunez,United States,7/29/2014,I was flying from Orlando to Vegas with connection in Houston. First flight was delayed about 4 hours (not due to weather so it was just because of United and their lack of or poor maintenance of planes). This made me miss my connecting flight so I had to wait in the huge line to get a flight to Vegas. I finally made it to Vegas about 5 hours later. They didn't apologize or give me anything for the inconvenience. Then the day came for my flight back to Orlando which I was dreading. My flight from Vegas to Houston wasn't too delayed so I figured it was a good day. Boy was I wrong. I arrive in Houston at around 2.30pm only to find out that my flight back home was cancelled and they put me on a flight to Orlando the next day at 9pm. I had to wait in the massive customer service line to see if I could get on an earlier flight. After about an hour I get to the front and they told me they can put me on a flight to Jersey with a connection to Orlando. It would get me home by 1am so I figured to do that. Well surprise surprise the flight to Jersey was delayed which made me miss the flight to Orlando which was the last flight. I had to stay the night in Jersey at the airport because they wouldn't pay for any hotel. All in all they had me hopping from state to state like if this was a game and never apologized. I'll never fly with them again.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

The delay did not augur well for my not-so-pleasant experience in the flight: no water in the loo food was miserable (the sweet sour chicken meal was kind of soupy and was tasteless) and one particular stewardess was quite snappy. The good thing was the uneventful flight which was a relief considering the week's news. Another good thing was my ""seatmate"" was transferred next to family so I had two seats to myself.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Salemson Edith,United States,7/29/2014,When boarding United flight 919 from LHR to IAD on July 22 2014 I was mortified to be humiliated by a flight attendant because I could not reach the overhead bin to stow my carry on bag. The plane is large and I am 5'1 not tall enough to reach the bin. At 69 I also do not have strength to lift a bag over my head. Berating this to me she said if I could not put the bag in the bin myself then it would have to be checked. Other passengers were shocked at her response to my predicament and of course a kindly tall gentleman immediately put it in the bin for me. On departing the aircraft a tall woman who had heard the attendant earlier came over to take down the bag. The attendant's attitude and manner was very rude. I was in seat 27D for which I had to pay an extra $125. I have been flying across the Atlantic for 53 years. This was my first and hopefully last trip I'll make on United.,,,Economy,,1,3,1,2,3,,,1,0

Hence am used to flying all round the world multiple airlines. United Airlines are the worst airline I have flown and would not recommend them to any traveler. My Honolulu to Newark flight 2 days ago was cancelled. The reason? ""The plane didn't arrive"". No explanation. No food voucher (not that we were going to get fed on a 10 hr flight anyway). Grumpy ground staff who obviously had had no customer service training. Luckily got reconnected through Delta who were obliging helpful and got us into NYC with no problem.

On the return trip the video on the plane was inoperative and we flew 10 hours with no movies or sound. The second leg from Washington to San Diego had no video screens available on the plane and the power plug under our seat did not charge our electronic device so we could not watch a movie we had downloaded as we used up our battery on the previous flight from Paris. To top it off one of our bags didn't arrive with the rest of our luggage and hasn't turned up a day later. Needless to say the airlines should have compensated us for the lack of video service during an international flight. The missing luggage might turn up hopefully! The crew were excellent.

Leg room of the economy seats was quite a problem. I had cramps so I had to move to the backmost seat which was free. I spent the duration of the entire flight from Heathrow to Newark (connecting flight) catching up with my readings. Seeing that I was busy and not relaxing at all the crew were nice and even gave me a box of chocolates! I must mention that the touchdown was the best I have experienced.

This time however the plane I was getting on in Albany was late arriving and thus we were late taking off. This resulted in our flight arriving in Newark too late to catch the connection flight. Not only was I now delayed a day but I was told by the airline that I would likely have to travel to LaGuardia by bus or taxi but they would not cover the cost. This is insane. Also the airline did not seem to have any thought of giving a discount. I purchased a service and the service was not provided. In any other industry I would not pay for this. This will be the last time I travel with United. I will pay the extra money and take a more reliable airline.,,,Economy,,1,4,3,3,2,,,1,0

Four croutons on my salad and ordinary less costly meal choices. 2 mid-priced white wines offered and wasn't even offered a refill during the meal. Had to pay 16.95 USD for WiFi despite a 10000+ USD ticket. Crew has rules about bags on the floor on take-off (even underneath the pod in First Class) and requests we wear shoulder plus lap belts - unlike other airlines.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,N Matson,China,7/27/2014,"United has recently changed its airplane (routing from PVG-ORD) from a 777 with personalized on-board entertainment in economy to a ""new"" 747 was shared projection screens. Also they recently changed their US/Asia route to also require payment for alcoholic beverages for those not in business or first-class. Travelling from China to the US quite often the 13+ hour flight seems even longer now that I have no control over what I can watch and no free drinks to ""shorten"" the travel time. In addition to these new changes the United crew has always been less than pleasant. It seems that the passengers are an inconvenience and I have heard the crew yell at each other on more than one occasion. Given the above I have changed my frequent flier membership to another Star Alliance airline and avoid flying United at all costs.

I used my miles to purchase a ticket back to New York last month and was a bit nervous because I hadn't flown with United in a while and wasn't sure how the quality would be. Luckily it was better than I expected! The entertainment was pretty old and barely usable unless I wanted to go deaf by turning up the volume to its max. Since I wasn't using it flight crew asked me to swap with a couple who had a broken machine which I did. The crew member then forgot to give me my drink skipping my row completely until I reminded him. I was a bit annoyed but you know staff get busy and flustered. I enjoyed my flight smooth and got home safely so cannot fault it. One thing that made me smile is that an older crew member who witnessed me giving up my seat and then getting my drink forgotten thanked me personally and talked about how the crew really wanted to encourage good experiences for everyone. Anyway I quite liked the flight so well done United.,,,Economy,,8,3,4,4,2,,,5,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,N Perkins,United States,7/27/2014,Ever since Continental merged with United it has been downhill. My flights are repeatedly delayed for various reasons but mainly due to technical issues because they have so many old planes still in service. On my most recent flight my flight was delayed for five hours. The plane did not show up for three hours due to 'weather grounding' which was totally false because the weather was fine in Houston even if there were thunderstorms it would not have grounded for three hours. Then we were boarded and the pilot mentioned they had technical issues. I still do not understand why they would board an entire plane before knowing if/how long it would take to repair everyone sat in the plane for two hours until they were finally able to fix and take off. We were told to contact United for 'compensation' due to the trouble and I was offered $50 (only because I have status otherwise it would have been $25) due to our inconvenience. Apparently a new policy just instituted to give you even less because in the past for something similar I received $100 and $150. They do not even care anymore about customer service so I am moving onto another airline.,,,Economy,,1,3,4,3,3,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,C Schultz,Germany,7/27/2014,We booked a flight from SFO to LAX on United and a separate flight from LAX to Europe. Layover in LAX was supposed to be 5 hours - but rather safe than sorry is what I thought - and sorry we were to be: Upon entering the aircraft doors closed we were informed of a minor delay due to traffic restrictions. A while later a technical problem was added to the mix and they promised to keep us informed. It kept going on like this for a while until about two hours later we were released from the plane and tried to get on the next flight. After a total of three hours the ticketing agent kindly re-booked us on a Delta flight to LAX. We landed just in time to possibly make it on our next plane but the surprise was that our baggage was still on the original plane. So we had to wait even longer in LAX re-book the flight till next day find a hotel and so on. I asked UA ground crew if they could offer assistance with any of it hoping my star alliance gold card might come in handy. It certainly did not.

For a 16 hour flight I was dreading the experience as I am 6'6"" tall. The seat was actually reasonably roomy and thankfully the middle seat of three was vacant. The idea that United now charges for alcoholic beverages on even such a long haul flight really sets them apart from their competition in a bad way. The food was probably the worst I've ever had on an airline and that's saying a lot. Entertainment options were fine but the remote control at y seat did not work and the touchscreen worked only badly. Watched one movie and then slept.

Several passengers requested clarity to the problem and were given vague excuses and lied to several times. When the final flight was boarding I along with several others were denied boarding as the plane provided was not large enough to accommodate all reservations. I spent that night in the airport and flew to a different location the next day. The staff were unprofessional and created nothing but frustration and anger for many passengers.

We flew coach today but honestly it doesn't seem to make a difference. Continental was a great airline that was merged with a terrible one and since the merger we have tried to avoid United wherever possible. Old United equipment substandard IFE overall bad attitudes no matter which cabin you find yourself in. Flying United is an endurance marathon. If we fly up front I am annoyed that we spent money or miles for bad attitudes. When we fly in the back I am annoyed by horrible service inedible food (we bring our own now) and shabby cabins.

Not once did we depart on-time. Newark was a disaster. We had our flight cancelled obtained a second flight but the customer service rep never suggested we try to get an earlier standby flight. Nobody called us from standby until I questioned the boarding attendant minutes prior to takeoff but managed to get onto the plane only to sit on the runway for over an hour because of a backup radio malfunction which ultimately caused the flight to be cancelled. After 7 hours we made it to Boston. Going home we arrived in Chicago and again on United's commuter connection we had another 2 hour wait while something on the plane was fixed. Service was poor especially in Newark where there were two hundred people waiting at customer service to rebook and two reps staffing the computers talking on a phone and letting a plane load of customers wait.

The only complaint I had concerning this flight is it makes no sense to me for the airline to load the front of the plane first. It would be more efficient and there would be far less congestion in the front of the aircraft. For the flight from LAX the ground staff were very sloppy and inattentive. United has rules concerning the size allowed for carry-ons. Many passengers were allowed to bring full-size suitcases on board and of course the overhead bins rapidly filled up. I was pleased to see the staff at Dulles for my return flight were enforcing the rules and numerous passengers had to check over sized carry-ons.

I made the mistake of doing a status match program after having Delta status for years simply because I thought that there was better options for flights into my business territory Canada. Today is the final straw in what has been a nightmarish year of unavoidable layovers constant delays cancelled flights and the worst customer service experience possible. I had a flight to Halifax scheduled today. I get to Newark airport for my 2 hour layover and see that my flight is leaving from Concourse A which has no lounge or other comfortable place to get work done. I take the dingy bus to Concourse B/C to use the lounge. While in the lounge I wasted a good hour trying to get Internet to work. I went to the front desk and reported that the Wifi was very slow. The lady behind the desk said that no one else had reported this then went on talking about her vacation pay hours remaining with another United employee. When I arrived in the lounge initially I asked while checking in if they were announcing all flights and was told yes. I did also hear them announce many flights but there was never an announcement for mine. I realized it was 7.05 and my flight left at 7.30. I raced to the bus to Concourse A by the time I arrived at Gate A20 was told that I would not be going to Halifax. I went to the customer care line where I stood for over 5 minutes while 2 agents ignored me. I sat there for almost 10 minutes while she typed away without saying a word to me. Finally she started telling me there was a flight from Houston tomorrow but no seats on it. I heard a passenger next to me say something about a flight to Moncton and asked the agent next to me if there was a flight to Moncton tonight. I asked the staff member to look into the Moncton flight and without saying a word she got up and walked away. Finally got onto the Moncton flight which left 40 minutes late.

I was surprisingly impressed with everything the check-in was fine there was no delays and the ""Premium Access"" (speedy boarding) was worth it. The entertainment options on the way out were of a good choice (by my standards) and sneakily ordering a special meal meant I got fed first (and it was still hot). Think it was chicken and something pretty good by economy standards. The seat was comfortable and obviously for the person in front of me to as she decided to recline her seat for the whole flight but I guess the fact of a spare seat beside me overcame the fact. I was slightly nervous about having to navigate Chicago as after reading reviews I thought it was going to be awfully daunting but everything was quick like seriously only 10 mins in the immigration line extremely impressed with that. Also sneaking into premium access and security at terminal 1 was an added bonus. I had a scheduled stop over of six hours but United decided to double it to 12 as the plane taking me to Wausau was delayed due to weather which I will say not entirely United's fault but some food and drink tokens would not of gone un-noticed.

The captain walked in next and announced that the ""tyre pressure was low"". After some conversation with the maintenance crew at the airport the captain announced that they will have to deplane us. My thoughts at that point were - why wasn't it looked at before the previous crew left the aircraft? Or afterwards? They kept intermittently announcing that the flight would take off now and then and so on. But eventually 6 hours after we first boarded the plane the flight was cancelled.

At 7pm when I went to check in online I found out that my flight had again been cancelled (couldn't blame the weather - reason given was no crew) and I was re- scheduled for a flight at 1.30pm. There was no email sent to me nor was I contacted to be informed of this change less than 10 hours before my flight.

How come United could not find more staff - this was known there would be cancellations predictable that flights would be cancelled. Overall a pretty shabby performance from United. Now again today they cancelled my flight - also did not inform me at all - I found out by accident by looking at their website. This was the only flight cancelled going to Harrisburg PA.

We were then sent to Houston airport where they got us on a flight to fly into Miami where our next flight could not leave until the next morning so we spent the night on the floor at the Miami airport. The experience to our destination was horrible flying United and their express flights. Once we were returning home on United they did not tell us we did not have to pay for our luggage again and let us pay again Once again the flight was unpleasant. Once we arrived into Houston our flight home was delayed again the experience with United Airlines was horrible and the flight attendants were very unfriendly.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,F Hryn,Canada,7/13/2014,I flew United 148 Newark to Geneva economy July 8. After reading other reviews I was prepared to expect less but was pleasantly surprised. The stewards and stewardesses were prompt with service and very friendly. Seat-back inflight entertainment provided me with many options to kill the 7.5 hour flight. The meal was good for an airplane meal and they were generous with drinks making numerous coffee/soda/water runs. The flight wasn't full and I was able to actually sleep on an international flight which made me happy since I had no one sitting next to me. We left Newark on time and arrived in Geneva on time. They got me there safely and cheerfully. What else can I ask for?,,,Economy,,10,4,5,5,4,,,4,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,B Wilkins,United Kingdom,7/13/2014,"Like many people I flew United because of the great service I used to receive when Continental was still around. After the merger United seems to actually try to become the worst airline in United States history! On my last 4 trips United was responsible for 6 flights. Out of the 6 5 had major issues. The first trip had two legs. The first flight was delayed 1.5 hrs because the pilots couldn't show up on time. That caused me to miss my connecting flight by 3 minutes. Because the connecting flight was missed they booked me on the next flight (after an hour wait in the Customer Service line at O'Hare). Well the next flight was delayed nearly 3 hours - 1.5 of which was on the tarmac! On the return trip I checked in to my LAX-ORD flight only to find out my seat had been canceled. After arguing with the ticket counter agent that I indeed paid to be on the flight they finally called their reservations department. They in turn told me that I cancelled the flight. After more arguing they finally conceded that my seat may have been ""accidentally canceled"" by the ORD customer service. Finally on my last connection from ORD-ATW I sat around for over 5 hours because the aircraft that was supposed to take the route was late coming in. Really? It's Chicago O'Hare airport United's biggest hub! They couldn't pull another ERJ-145 into service? I could have driven to ATW and back (probably should have) in the amount of time I waited for the delayed aircraft. Despite having been a loyal Continental customer for over a decade I will not be flying United again in my lifetime.",,,Premium Economy,,1,2,1,1,2,,,3,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Steve Rodriguez,United States,7/13/2014,The wife and I purchased a last minute Vegas package deal in June through Priceline. We got a non-stop round trip flight with United. We have flown with them before and never had any problems. Unfortunately there was a death in the family and we had to change our departure date. I was not sure if we were locked into our package itinerary and would have to buy new tickets to get home so I called United's Customer Service. I advised them of our situation and the need to go home. There staff told me not to worry and assured me they would get us back in time for the funeral. They arranged a non-stop flight for us to get home with no extra fees. There courteous and swift service was greatly appreciated.,,,Economy,,10,3,4,3,3,,,4,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,K Carter,United States,7/13/2014,Flew from SLC to DFW with my two toddlers. Our first flight from SLC-Houston was delayed about 40 minutes which gave me 20 minutes to get on my flight in Houston to DFW. I gate checked my stroller so I could use it to get from one flight to the next. After our flight I waited for the stroller and it never came. A baggage worker approached me and told me that he couldn't bring my stroller up because it had a white tag when it needed the pink tag. I told him that I needed to get to a flight that was leaving in 20 minutes. He was nice and offered to get the stroller onto my next flight. I trusted he would and ran to our next flight dragging my two screaming kids with me. We barely made it before it took off. When we landed in DFW I again waited at the gate for my stroller. It never came. I again dragged my two toddlers across the airport to baggage claim. The stroller still wasn't there. I eventually found the stroller without anyone's help.

Repairs made and flight was smooth and safe. But this put many people into flux because of missed connections. Houston airport was a total mess with people milling around and scrambling for standby options. We had a package of frozen fish we did not care to lose. We would approach the podiums for standby only to be advised the flight was already overbooked. On top of that many flights did not have a crew on the ground and had to await arrival on yet another messed up flight. I feel for the employees. Some were very nice and helpful but many but totally burned out and fighting with each other. This is a nasty situation and I encourage another airline at the moment.,,,Economy,,5,4,4,1,3,,,4,0

On the way back they gave away my paid for ticket that I purchased 2 months in advanced to someone who bought it 2 hours before.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,D Harvey,United States,7/6/2014,United's poor handling of airline operations and poor customer service led to two cancelled flights and nine hour in the airport on June 30 (ending on July 1 at 3.30am) for my originally scheduled flight #518 from Chicago ORD to Portland OR (PDX). After arriving 3 hours late into ORD on a flight from Munich because of an unscheduled stop in Boston to change pilots I arrived to find flight #518 from ORD to PDX delayed because of a maintenance issue. After three delays two gate changes and three hours the flight was cancelled. I was reassigned to Flight #627 scheduled to depart at 8.25pm. If my original flight had left on time I would have missed the weather delay that started at about 7pm and lasted for an hour or so. The weather delay did mess things up and flights were diverted to wait for the weather to pass. Our incoming plane was diverted to Rockford IL for a ground stop and then never made it to Chicago. We had 7 official delays several noted only after the original delay deadline had passed and then the delay was only another 30 to 45 minutes so not much time to go get food etc. We had 3 gate changes during the process the last of which brought us back to the gate where our plane for Flight #518 was still sitting still with its mechanical problems. Our inbound aircraft never made it no alternative aircraft could be brought to the gate even though there was an alternate aircraft available and the flight crew timed out at just before 2am when they cancelled the flight. They offered a hotel voucher but the closest hotel was 20 miles away. After 26 hours travelling the last nine being at ORD I left for a hotel I had to pay for an hour away in downtown Chicago.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,E Oddo,United States,7/6/2014,I am a Premier Silver member on United. I am on the verge of switching airlines for future travel due to the horrible experience I'm having. I used miles to book a ticket from Sao Paulo to Chicago. They cancelled the flight (UAL 844) on July 1 (apparently weather in Chicago) again (UAL 844) on July 2 and automatically rebooked me on a flight on July 4 with a connection through Washington D.C. There has been zero communication from United except for an automatic rebooking email. Hundreds of travelers are now stranded at a Holiday Inn on the outskirts of Sao Paulo Brazil. I will be stranded in Sao Paulo for four extra days! I consistently attain Premier Silver status and always defend United when other customers complain of how bad an airline it is. Since I fly out of Chicago O'Hare I know I have other options in terms of airlines. I do not even know if I will make it out on July 4. The hotel we are at has provided no information to any of the customers in terms of what is the next step. As United increases capacity to try to build revenue they need to not forget about what matters the most: the customer. If this is not resolved to my satisfaction I will be taking my business to American Airlines (or elsewhere).,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

I have written to them twice now to protest their terrible baggage policies that encourage people to game the system and bring large heavy luggage to the gate so that they can get it on for free rather than paying for checking. This means long delays and dangerous conditions on board as people try to lift bags that are too heavy for them over the heads of other passengers putting them in danger. Indeed this last flight I took a direct hit on my head from a passenger's backpack that was too heavy for her. No attendant came to see if I was safe and uninjured. Attendants told me they could not announce that passengers should be careful of other passengers when loading luggage because it would be a ""deviation from the script"" and get them in trouble.

We boarded our flight in Austin and arrived to Chicago with no problems. In Chicago we boarded our connecting flight but were told we were going to have to sit on the runway for a while because of the thunderstorms going on. About 30 minutes later we had to deplane for our safety. When we got off the plane we discovered numerous flights had been canceled due to weather. About 15 minutes later they got us back on the plane and told us we just had to fuel up and that they were going to get us to Portland that night. So then we waited out the weather for 6 hours and finally it was clear enough to take off at midnight. However one of the flight attendants timed out right when we were about to push back from the gate at midnight so they canceled it and told us to go wait in the customer service line to rebook. The line stretched over 10 gates and wasn't really helping any customers. Called customer service instead and was told there were no flights from Chicago to Portland until 3 days later and the best they could do for us was fly us to Hartford Connecticut - a 4 hour drive from Portland. Told our luggage would be sent to our destination Portland and would be waiting for us once we drove there. When we finally arrived in Portland at 6pm 24 hours after we were supposed to 3/4 bags hadn't even arrived. They have lost my family as customers.,,,Economy,,2,2,1,2,1,,,2,0

Purchased at least a month in advance checked in the day before received tickets with our seat assignments while checking our bags. So far so good. At the gate they informed us that United overbooked First Class-still plenty of seats on plane-just overbooked First Class-not sure how you do that-since the odds of ""no shows"" happening with FC seats has to be rare. I understand overbooking the plane but not a section. We were told since we did not purchase the tickets with money we were the lucky losers.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Howard,United States,7/1/2014,June 27th 2014 - I usually avoid United because I have very rarely had a flight that wasn't delayed or cancelled outright with little to no notice. Today was no exception with a delay causing over a 90 minute delay. Nearly 25% of the other passengers on this flight were unable to get to connecting flights with this delay and were summarily told to pound salt when asked what United could/would do for them. Myself being only minorly inconvenienced could only hang my head in sympathy for passengers who would inevitably be left in Chicago O'Hare (also with it's share of issues) but when other passengers began comparing experiences on United they all agreed that this was relatively common regardless of destination. I cannot recommend United to anyone and suggest they actively avoid using this airline unless they absolutely don't need to get to their destination on time. Avoid using United Airlines unless you don't care about being on time or even arriving the same scheduled day. The fares are a poor bait and switch tactic and I would be surprised if the FAA does not step in soon.,,,Economy,,1,3,3,3,1,,,4,0

I have to say though that elements of the experience have improved over the last few years. A cloth hot towel has been re-introduced and even though they ran our of food items in the first class cabin the breakfast selection was good. Besides a scrambled eggs option they had a healthy oat bran choice as well that I really enjoyed. Moreover they also came by during the flight with a fruit basket.

The plane was clean the in-flight entertainment had a great selection of movies and TV shows and the crew were very friendly and helpful. The only problem I have with United's international flights is the lack of free beer and wine in Economy Class. Flight 597 to MSP boarded on time but then we sat on the tarmac for 50 minutes before we were given clearance to leave. Once we did finally take off the rest of the flight was fine. I'm a very happy United customer and would recommend this airline to anyone.

Horrible experience. Started with denying us access to the Global First Lounge as we were on Aeroplan miles even though their website says flying in Global First grants access to the lounge. They sent us three rail stops away to the Lufthansa Business Lounge so we could shower after the 10 hour+ flight from Vienna. The Gate Area was a mess with over 300 people crammed into a small area lining up like cattle in divided rows for 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 lanes - worse then Southwest. The plane came in late. We had to move to another Gate Area from C12 to D3 for another aircraft. The second Gate Area was larger. After a 1 hour and 38 minute delay we took off. Despite only 8 seats in Global First they don't get to board first. You must wait in Lane 1. Seems like an odd policy. The seats and cabin are very nice no complaints. The video/audio choices extensive except the screen is a little small compared to other carriers. For a transcon the drink/meal service stunk. The flight attendants were pleasant but UA offers no menus no champagne a tiny nut dish of peanuts and almonds limited food choices (chicken or pasta) all served at once on a plastic tray. The quality of food was poor. The sundae was very nice. Now I understand why United is having such a difficult time.

I am not a fussy flyer at all and can usually go to sleep easily. I am also an Aussie meaning I am used to the 'service' Qantas provides. However after my experience with United I am going to go easy on Qantas. I'll start my review with - ""wow"". It actually takes more effort than less to be as terrible as United. From the no entertainment system on-board (standard I'm told on a 12 hour flight) terrible food (I live in Asia and I know what bad food is) multiple gate changes (5 in total in 1 hour) and 2 hour delay (no apology). Then there was the possibly the rudest individuals I've ever met posing as flight attendants. I am not sure who employed these folk or why on earth they decided to work in the service industry but they were not only dismissive cold and patronising towards guests they actually made the whole flight a tense and uncomfortable environment. In summary I don't understand UA's play. They act like a low’ cost airline. I say 'low low' because the majority of low cost airlines play in the mid tier now. As a national carrier I don't understand this. They can't beat Southwest so you'd think service would be a priority. Manners are free last time I checked. Once again it takes more effort to be that terrible then it would to provide a half decent service. They are too many alternatives to put yourself through a UA experience. The most interesting part of this is all they have to do is look at Qantas and others who behaved like this in the late 90s and ended up losing half of their market share and have been struggling since.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,A Ehmen Carlotta,United States,6/25/2014,We have flown with a number of other airlines both internationally and domestic and flying United was a nightmare. Weather is out of everyone's control but management of the overall system is a disaster and not equipped on the front line to deal with flight problems. We normally fly in and out of MSP but United ORD on the surface offered better options for connections to and from Toronto. The problems in Chicago from what information we managed to get (mostly from other passengers both on our flight and other flights) were they did not know where aircraft crews were where the planes were coming and going or what gate (we were moved 3 times-one of which was on the opposite end of the terminal). We have had less delays and problems flying out of MSP in brutal winter weather. They make no announcements and changes are not posted timely and if you can't get an audience with very limited counter agents you find out your flight has been cancelled when the boarding time has come and gone. We witnessed that time and again. We were rebooked on the same flight 24 hours later-and as expected no luggage when we arrived-the tracking showed the time and place it was checked in more than 24 hours earlier at ORD-no progress up the chain in over 24 hours. I honestly feel for the counter people who have to deal with the chaos and irate passengers with little information and resources to fix problems-no wonder they may be less than friendly at times. I do believe there are huge and unnecessary internal problems with this airline (or airport) because we have flown from coast to coast foreign countries and very bad weather with other airlines (and airports) that managed to deal with flight problems in a more efficient and passenger friendly manner.

This occurred in 4 out of my 5 recent transpacific flights. The purser came and apologized. She said United loaded only four such meals into a business class that seats 44 passengers! With a destination that is Taipei it's astounding that United didn't bother to prepare more Asian food options. It seems to never happen when I fly Asiana Cathay Singapore or Lufthansa. It happens only on United. Is United hedging on meals to save money? And what is this 2-4-2 business class configuration? It's pretty bad given that for the same fare one can fly in a much more spacious environment on competing airlines. I wish United would dismantle these terrible seats.,,,Business Class,,4,2,3,1,3,,,2,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,B Scott,United States,6/23/2014,"DEN to ORD on a new (or with a new interior) A-320 and was very disappointed. UA has removed the entertainment system on this new plane both audio and video so if you like listening to ""From the Cockpit"" you are out of luck. Not everyone is always traveling with a laptop so on long flights the absence of entertainment will be very noticeable. The top of the slimline seat in front of me felt like it was right in front of my face and the new skinny armrests were very short and uncomfortable. The A-320 used to be my favorite plane on UA but if this is a sign of things to come it won't be any longer.",,,Economy,,4,2,3,3,1,,,3,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Aija Hughes,United States,6/23/2014,"My flight out from SFO was overbooked by 4 and there were some ""hold your breath"" moments until 4 people decided to give up their tickets and take an alternate flight. I had a connecting flight in Denver to Lincoln Nebraska. Fortunately I had a 3 hour layover in Denver which gave me plenty of time to walk from one end of the airport to the other for a connecting flight and believe me when I say it is a long haul. If anyone has a short time span to get to a connecting flight I suggest they arrange for a cart. Passenger space on United is cramped. I sat beside a big guy and had to lean well over into the aisle in order for both of us to be able to sit in the side by side seats. My return from Lincoln to SFO was a nightmare. I arrived in Lincoln got my boarding pass and when I looked at the pass and compared the time on it to the departure time listed on the board I noticed that departure was at least one hour later - which meant that I would miss my connecting flight in Denver. When I pointed this out to someone in the airport departure gate area they told me to get on the red phone to see if an alternate connection could be arranged. Once the plane finally arrived and I boarded there was still a good possibility that I would miss my revised connecting flight in Denver. I got on one of the cars that transport passengers from one gate to another arrived 15 minutes before the connecting flight was scheduled to depart and found that it also had arrived late and was just disembarking. This of course delayed the scheduled departure time of that flight. Finally to my relief I boarded the flight from Denver to SFO only to sit on tarmac for over an hour due to lightning thunder and rain. You pay for selecting seats you pay for luggage you pay for snacks and for the flight but you are packed into an exceptionally small seating space in which you cannot even fully put your tray down comfortably. Passengers should be treated better even if they fly economy.",,,Economy,,3,1,4,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,John Kneijber,Australia,6/23/2014,We flew LGA-DEN-LAX in United First. Were able to use the United Clubs in both La Guardia and Denver as we were continuing on an international flight from LAX on a Star Alliance Carrier. Pleasant check-in agent checked our bags direct through to Brisbane which saved us having to collect luggage in Los Angeles. First leg on A319 with only 8 in the first cabin was fantastic. One of the best FAs we have ever encountered. Food was very good and drinks flowed freely. Only gripe on this sector was lack of in flight entertainment. The aircraft was equipped with Wi-Fi but you had to pay to use it even in the first class cabin. Not much positive to write about the second leg on B737-900. One food option offered. If you didn't want it too bad. Not even offered a snack from the buy on board menu. Once service was over the FAs sat in the galley and proceeded to talk extremely loudly for the rest of the flight. You could hear them even with headphones on. This aircraft had free TV options. Overall score is largely based on first leg of this trip.,,,First Class,,8,4,4,4,2,,,3,1

Like all my previous experiences flying on United not only does the flight board beyond the stated time we pull out of the gate 40 minutes late only to be told while sitting on the runway that we are going to be held 30 minutes in our position. It's bad enough that the seats are extremely small now we're delayed over 1 hour total which causes issues with our connections.

I am not a fussy flyer at all and can usually go to sleep easily. I am also an Aussie meaning I am used to the 'service' Qantas provides. However after my experience with United I am going to go easy on Qantas. I'll start my review with - ""wow"". It actually takes more effort than less to be as terrible as United. From the no entertainment system on-board (standard I'm told on a 12 hour flight) terrible food (I live in Asia and I know what bad food is) multiple gate changes (5 in total in 1 hour) and 2 hour delay (no apology). Then there was the possibly the rudest individuals I've ever met posing as flight attendants. They were not only dismissive cold and patronising towards guests they actually made the whole flight a tense and uncomfortable environment. In summary I don't understand UA's play.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Saketh Rahm,United States,6/23/2014,I recently completed 3 trips on United DEN-LGA and EWR-DEN with 5 out of 6 segments in First. Overall the product is decent for domestic first class. Crew on all 6 legs were generally very friendly and chatty with the passengers (all were DEN or SFO based). They worked the whole 4 hour flight and were constantly refilling glasses. Food was a little bland but was served well along with fresh baked cookies. Problem is inconsistency in on-board products with old CO aircraft having in seat TV and UA aircraft with old overhead monitors. Some aircraft's with WI-Fi and some without which makes it difficult to work. Of the 6 flights 3 were right on time with early arrivals and 3 were delayed 45 minutes mainly because of ATC issues in NYC area.,,,First Class,,8,3,4,3,4,,,5,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Caitlyn Malcynsky,United States,6/20/2014,"I travel all the time for business and booked on United for cost reasons I was flying last-minute from LGA to MSP. I was scheduled to depart at 6pm from NY change planes in Chicago with an hour layover time and land in Minneapolis by 9.30pm. Departing flight was listed ""on time"". 5.45 boarding still had not begun - asked the gate attendant when we would be boarding since I had a connector. He informed me that they were about to delay the flight indefinitely. After advice from customer service that my original flight is unlikely to take off in time for me to make any connection in Chicago I am rebooked on a flight scheduled to depart an hour later - 7pm. However this means I will miss my O'Hare connection so that is also rebooked to a 10pm CDT flight. 7pm flight boards on time. Around the time of boarding the originally-scheduled 6pm flight also starts the boarding process. Chaos at the 7pm flight's gate as multiple irate businessmen who had changed out of their 6pm first- class seats for a time-saving economy seat on the 7pm scramble to articulate their outrage and get rebooked on the now-departing earlier flight. At 7.10pm the 7pm flight is finally loaded - and completely full. It's sweltering hot and ripe with body odor and very very dimly lit. 7.20pm: still hot still smelly still dark. Flight attendants are trying their best to be accommodating. The plane finally acquires a couple of pilots 45 minutes after scheduled departure. At this point I am getting nervous that I may miss my re-booked connector as well in which case I will either have to overnight in Chicago or drive the 6.5 hours to St. Paul. The plane touches down in Chicago only a little bit late despite the delay in take-off. Stopped on the runway in the middle of taxi - stops for at least 20 minutes. Flight attendant makes an attempt to ask passengers to remain seated so those with tight connectors can deplane first. His plea is denied immediately by the scores of tired and angry people who flood the corridor before the plane has even reached the gate. Fighting through 35 rows of people I manage to deplane with 10 minutes to spare before boarding call for the connection. Arrive sweaty and out of breath at the gate just as my phone brings up a text from United: flight is delayed until 10.30 because the plane hasn't arrived. The gate attendant changes the sign to read 10.45 instead. Once 1035 hits she updates it once more - to 10.51. In short she assures there is no possible way I will arrive before midnight (CDT).

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,S McMillan,United States,6/20/2014,"SFO-CDG-SFO. Over the past couple of years I have had the opportunity to travel internationally on both United and several foreign carriers. United's First Class or Business First Class service and amenities are no better than those in economy on the foreign carriers. Outbound we didn't get drinks prior to take off as the flight attendants were spending way too much time chatting with the other passengers. The meals were satisfactory though I am getting a bit bored with the ice cream sundae. The inflight entertainment worked well though it would have been nice to have different choices on the return flight. The only thing United's front cabin had going for it was more comfortable seats than in the back of the plane however even that comes with a ""but"". On the 767 the pods next to the window have very limited room for your feet when in the flat position. The aisle seats do seem to have more room. I travel weekly for work so I will continue to fly United but if I were a leisure traveler without frequent flyer status I would choose another airline.

Each time has been progressively worse. Every flight was delayed beginning with my flight out of Huntsville and on each connecting flight. One time they said it was some latch was broken or something to do with the luggage conveyor belt to load the suitcases into the airplane. Another time someone forgot to turn the AC on in the airplane and it was 90 degrees inside (it was a hot day). Each delay was at least an hour. The flight attendants were rude and quick tempered. They snapped at myself and other passengers I observed on more than one occasion. They seemed to always be in a rush and as I was sitting in an aisle seat I was rudely bumped into by one of them as they flew by. No apologies were made. Oh and the service was usually late and the food was of questionable quality as well. In short it was such a miserable experience it almost made my trip to Germany not worth it. The seats on the 747 were so jam packed together I always felt squashed into the neighboring passenger. Their computers were broken at the airport and so there was another half hour delay getting through customs was horrible enough on my return trip but dealing with United's mess was just reprehensible.,,,Premium Economy,,1,1,1,2,3,,,2,0

Compare them to All Nippon for example where the attendants are super friendly and bend over backwards for passengers. The return leg was late out of SFO by about 90 minutes.

Unbelievable. We landed 8 hours after the original time we were told. United uses primarily outdated planes with no on-demand in-flight entertainment. When they do offer their on-demand entertainment like Live DirecTV it costs money. Long flights (7+) could offer good personal TVs but that is rare. Wifi is unheard of my flight months ago was promised wifi but once boarded they claimed the original plane had to be switched so no wifi. Customer service is atrocious also. We were offered $7 each for food at the airport we had to wait at but that's it. I know a friend who had two flights cancelled in the same night due to airline problems.

They added 30 minutes delay at the destination waiting for luggage unnecessarily for all those people? Why are advertising that we are allowed ""one carry-on bag and one personal item"" and flying planes that do not have enough space for them? On my last United flight they made me check my carry-on bag because it didn't easily slide into their sizer though it would have with a push and would easily fit overhead.

Had wanted to take the 757 flight from Berlin to Newark since the route was opened up by Continental. Since the merger between the two airlines is far from complete I knew the crew would all be Continental and knowing how poorly the new United is perceived not just by customers but staff too the old- fashioned Continental Airlines flight bag I hauled out of the back of my closet scored me a glass of champagne as I passed through the forward galley en route to my economy seat. Left on time catering was decent (one area the new United hasn't yet cut to the bone) although movie choices were limited to new releases so I read my book and did some work. Immigration at Newark was relatively painless due to the early scheduled arrival time of 1200 beating the afternoon rush. Short visit to the United Club which is comfortable although the snack options are awful. For the second leg to Los Angeles found myself back at the gate I'd arrived at. Some infrequent fliers consider narrowbody hardware unsuitable for long haul as it is “cramped” or “claustrophic take it from someone who flew on the same 757 all the way from Berlin to LA the size of the seat is the same as the biggest planes (except 10-abreast 777s where it is considerably narrower) and the smaller numbers at boarding baggage claim and immigration mean small is beautiful.

We were scheduled to return to the United States on Monday 5/9/2014. Our scheduled flight was delayed 3.5 hours due to weather in Texas. This was understandable. The rest of this journey was not. In Mexico we were switched from our connecting flight due to the scheduled departure time. The flight we were switched to departed prior to our arrival at the Houston Airport. My family along with several others in our same situation then attempted to obtain another flight. The United personnel at the Houston Airport were very rude and not at all helpful. We spent over 16 hours in the airport with no blankets pillows or cots. I will never again fly United. The delays were one thing but the attitude of the employees was completely unacceptable.,,,Business Class,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

Small tray with all courses at the same time followed by a cookie in a paper bag. For a 5 hour flight this is ridiculous. Hawaii routes are served with the oldest run down aircraft.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Steve Rabin,United States,6/10/2014,UA1284 EWR-SFO 14 May 2014. No IFE or WiFi on a transcon? That's what I found when flying on brand new 737-900. I've flown UA's older -900s and they have DirecTV-okay you have to pay for it but it's still better than nothing. The flight itself was pleasant the new seats reasonably comfortable. One thing I've always liked about UA is that at least one flight attendant comes out every 30 minutes or so and has cups of water or the beverage cart coming around. But no entertainment? I could have flown Southwest they don't claim to have IFE on their flights.,,,Economy,,6,2,4,2,1,,,3,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,S Wahl,United States,6/10/2014,The relatively short commute between Durango CO and Cleveland OH was the worst trip I have experienced. I have never had any trip since the inception of Denver International Airport that has gone without an aircraft maintenance problem. This recent trip held me hostage on a small aircraft and at the airport for 8 hours. I have never seen such an appalling record of mechanical breakdowns as I've seen with aircraft at Denver's airport. Both the departure and return trips were plagued with mechanical problems. The return trip was on board an aircraft meant for short duration flights of less than 1 hour and was used for a trip spanning over 3 hours. When we were supposed to circle the airport for a short period of time we had to divert to Cheyenne WY to refuel. The plane was too small to carry the necessary amount of fuel. As a result I missed my connection and waited 7 hours before taking off to my final destination. On the outbound trip we had to return to DIA due to a mechanical failure of an engine. We had already flown 45 minutes and instead of landing in an airport we were close to we had to fly back 45 minutes wait for another plane and take off in the middle of the night. We landed at 12.45 am. I have flown from different cities (Manhattan KS and Albuquerque NM) to Alaska three times and not once did I experience any problems with aircraft. The main difference was that none of these trips included United Airlines and Denver International Airport.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,A Clark,United States,6/5/2014,ORD-DCA and BWI-ORD. Overall the experience was very good. All flights departed and arrived on time and all employees were friendly. The trip was through a tour so the price or value cannot be determined. Security on Monday at O'Hare was very crowded so be sure to allot enough time. Boarding was organized and most bags were checked at the gate because the overhead bins would have been to crowded. The seats on board were very comfortable and recline was decent. The plane was an A319 that has not been reconfigured with the slimline seating. Crew was very nice and efficient and Inwas given an entire can of apple juice. We arrived at National Airport on time and the bags were very fast to come off of the carousel. The airport is very convenient to access downtown DC. Return was at BWI which is only 20 miles outside DC however traffic was a nightmare and it took almost an hour to get there. Gate agents at the airport were very friendly and efficient. Security is very smooth here and the airport is overall pleasant. Boarding was quick and the flight was operated by a 737-900ER. The seats were comfortable and no one bought the direct TV. Recline wasn't much which made sleeping difficult but I was not in economy plus. The crew on board were nice but not as good as others. The flight arrived on time and bags were quick to come out of the carousel. United seems like they are beginning to overcome merger issues now.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,4,2,,,5,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,A Clark,United States,6/5/2014,"April 26 FLL-CLE. My friend flew with miles and I flew for $400. Not bad considering that it was booked 3 weeks in advance and during a popular travel time. Check in crew and gate agents at FLL are outstanding. So friendly and willing to help out. The check in crew were smiling and friendly and helped out with checked bag issue. The gate agent was the best I've seen. She was so helpful to the passengers in wheelchairs and kept everyone fully informed. The crew onboard were friendly and very attentive. Always asking customers if everything was ok and picked up trash frequently. Somehow the flight departed 40 minutes late due to there being only one operational runway in FLL. We didn't hear the captain inform us about it or speak once during the flight. The flight was completely full. The flight was on a A320 with the new slimline seats. The legroom was adequate for my height of 5' 10"" however the seat was very hard and didn't recline very far. I purchased the wifi and for $5 was a great deal. No music or overhead screens on this plane. Connection through Cleveland was very easy and the airport was very easy to connect through. Flight from CLE to ORD was 60% full and had another great crew. They were very enthusiastic. The flight was operated by a 737-700 with very comfortable seats. Not one person on board purchased the over priced direct TV. Flight arrived on time bags quickly arrived at carousel. Overall United was decent.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,A Findlay,United Kingdom,6/5/2014,LHR-EWR and back. You do get what you pay for with this airline but they really should do something to improve on the overall quality of their planes and service. The 757s look extremely dated now - once white plastic fascias now looking grey/brown. Curtain divider between Economy and Business a tatty net curtain that doesn't cover the width of the doorway. On both flights the toilet illumination signs were flickering constantly and added to the air of shabbyness. The only long haul airline I have flown in the last 5 years where in Economy you do not get any inflight entertainment system. All you get is films on a loop. I had to wait 20mins for the loop to start again. Flew LHR-SFO last October and on the EWR-LHR route this time the same film selection was playing as in October. Particularly galling as I paid a cheaper price for a trip to Thailand on Thai Airways last year and the IFE was excellent. Staff whilst pleasant are genuinely uninterested took 10 mins to answer my call to ask them to get my bag out of the overhead locker as the passengers either side of me were asleep. You have to pay for the alcoholic beverages - $7 for a 125ml bottle of red wine is an unbelievable rip off. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have sat in with the exception of Ryanair where you expect an uncomfortable ride. On the plus side there is an extremely good availability of economy plus seats and the legroom really is superb in these seats but this does not make up for the overall comfort of the seat. The price to upgrade to Economy plus is the same as paying for an extra legroom seat on Virgin Atlantic and is less than half as good.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

I made the mistake of booking United for the short 40 minute trip from Doha to Dubai (United has a daily Washington DC-Doha-Dubai flight). Security at Doha airport for this particular flight was exhausting with United staff fingerprinting passengers taking off shoes etc as if we were going to the US instead of just Dubai. The plane was a tired creaky old B-777. Flight attendants whose average age was nearly 60 were grumpy and rude. Only a stale bagel was served.

Meantime a violent thunderstorm/tornado warning further delayed departure until we were 2.5 hours late leaving. Needless to say our connection to Hilo HI was way gone before we arrived. We were bumped from one customer service desk to another. The line at Gate 71 never moved for an hour. Children were tired and screaming while the customer service reps mumbled useless statements waited for phone returns and after an hour declared we had no hotel or meal compensation because DIA coded the departure as late due to ""weather"". If the plane had been ready at departure time there would have been no delay. The rude and helpless reception at Los Angeles resulted in several of us sleeping in the airport all night missing a full day of reserved vacation time a change in destination from Hilo to Kona a change in car rental arrangements and a long drive around the island instead of 30 miles as originally planned.

The captain tried his best to kept us updated on the delays. Instruction of allowing passengers to leave the plane during the delay was not clear resulted in passenger wandering around the bridge area. Cabin crew changed after the 2nd delay which turned out to be a plus point to us. Original crew serving the upper deck was grumpy the replacement crew (original crew gone probably due to extended hour) was fantastic provided one of the better quality service to a almost fully filled business class cabin. The plane was old and there was sign of dirt especially around the edges of the window frame. Seat itself was comfortable. It is weird to see UA cramping 2-4-2 seat in business class.

So I put one slipper in my carry on and went on my way. Flew on an EMB175 from Louisville to Houston which was way to small of a plane for that distance but I pretty much slept the whole flight. Then was on a 787 Dreamliner from Houston to Denver. Thought that was kind of a big plane for that flight but what a brilliant aircraft. New quiet and very comfortable. The plane was heading to Tokyo from Denver hence the need for the large craft. Then an A320 on to Reno.

The plane had a mechanical problem half way to Houston and had to land in Memphis. More than 100 people were asked to stay at Memphis airport and wait for another plane to come. We waited for 7 hours from 1.30 to 8.30. The airport staff first said that the plane would come at 7.30 and later announced that it would be one hour late. All stores in Memphis airport closed around 6.30 and we were all starving. United did at least bring some food for us in this situation. We missed our connecting flight and had to call our hotel and pick-up shuttle to explain the situation. We eventually arrived at Houston around 11pm. There were only 2 people at Houston to help the customers arrange hotels and airport shuttles and they worked extremely inefficiently since they didn't seem to know what to do. In the end it took them 3 hours to get everyone arranged. Up to this point I am totally disappointed with United Airline. I'd rather pay a little more to get a better service.

They didn't give me a hotel room because the problem was due to ""weather"" but that was simply not true. They told us on the plane that we boarded that we needed to go back to the airport because the crew had overworked their permitted number of hours and they had no other crew to replace them with. I told them I would literally take any flight that would get me out of that city and the flight I did get was canceled within a few hours of booking it. I went back to customer service and I felt like I was a bother to them for simply needing a way out of there to avoid sleeping on their floors again.

When we informed about the allergy to crew on board flight 488 they told us they can't make announcement about nut allergy due to change in policy and could not able to help us. Finally some of the passengers around us helped to request everyone about the allergy. The second leg of Journey (Flight 1121) crew told us they will make a courtesy announcement.

The seats in economy are among the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. The United staff - who were long time Continental employees - were very embarrassed and said it should never have happened. And of course it should not have.

The departure staff were some of the rudest uncooperative staff we have had to deal with. Having stood in ""row 5"" to board and submitting our boarding passes we were told our hand luggage had to be put in the hold as the overhead lockers were full. This was very unsatisfactory as we were ticketed through to Perth. There was no checking of legal size of cabin bags. We saw many oversize bags go aboard including a musical instrument case at least 4 foot long. People putting their second piece in overheads instead of at their feet. If this was policed there would have been room for all legal sized bags. As we are aged 75 and 77 we had medicine required to be taken on the 27 hour journey. After removing medicine we allowed bags to be placed in hold. As the plane was about to leave gate we realized our passports were in our hand luggage. On approaching the head stewardess and the captain and explaining we would be unable to leave USA until passports were returned. Only through the captains orders our hand luggage was unloaded and brought up to the cabin. Full marks to the captain he placed one bag in the cockpit and the head stewardess rearranged some other bags for the second one. This delayed departure by 15 minutes due to the incompetent staff at boarding gate not listening to where we were going. San Francisco to Sydney was poor service poor food no drinks unless you purchased them. Qantas flight Sydney to Perth only a 4 hour flight and free drinks with meal and the offer of second one .",,,Economy,,2,1,3,3,1,,,2,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,R Gibson,United States,5/21/2014,"Rome to Newark (EWR) in Business First departing at 9:50 a.m. We were lucky that we could use the miles we had accrued with the United Mileage Plus card for this trip and were very happy with the flight. United uses Alitalia lounge for BusinessFirst customers which is located in the basement of the terminal. It's very dated with white leather chairs and orange plexiglass dividers between seating sections. There is a bar just beyond the entrance which looked very poorly stocked with almost empty bottles of various liquor and the surly server behind the counter begrudging made espressos on order. Food consisted of some bread butter jam small croissants and cold cereal. Overall a real disappointing experience. The flight was announced in the lounge and we proceeded to board. We were in seats 3K and 3L. Others have commented that the person in the window seat has to climb over the person in the aisle seat which is true. Once seated we were offered a choice of OJ Champagne Mimosa or water and handed our menus. Our flight attendants introduced themselves as did the flight customer service manager (not really sure what that means). After takeoff we were offered a beverage and warm nuts. Food service began and was very well done - in courses. Four options for entrees were given and wine was offered throughout the meal service. After lunch a cheese cart was offered followed by made-to-order sundaes. All in all very good. The new seats are fairly comfortable although at 6'1"" I found myself having to bend my legs a bit when lying down. Working the leg/foot and head rests took some getting used to. My biggest criticism would be that the ""storage"" shelf is over your shoulder and behind you. This includes the jack for the headset which I kept pulling out when I turned in the seat. It was hard to get to and pretty unusable. The entertainment selection was excellent with great late run movies television shows and music. An hour before landing we were offered a snack consisting of a chicken empanda fruit salad cucumber salad and chocolate. We landed 1/2 hour early and were the first off the plane. All in all a great flight.",,,Business Class,,9,3,5,5,5,,,5,1

I would look forward to more planes look like the Dreamliner in regards to age and cleanness. I have no complaints but just general concerns. Economy Plus is just the more legroom nothing more nothing less. It's the small things that can add up a pillow here and tiny bag of peanuts there and lets say a complementary cocktail on longer flights in Eco Plus to stand up to the ""Premium Eco Class"" and to be ""Eco Plus friendly.

Flight from DEN-YXE was delayed twice on the way out. Then flying from YXE-DEN we sat in a small hot plane sweating for over an 1.5 hours after landing because Customs wasn't open for business yet and we weren't allowed off the plane. It is a daily flight so they should know when customs opens? Transfer from DEN-EUG had no gate until 2 hours prior which changed 2 times missed the flight because the last change was 20 minutes prior. Next flight out was 10 hours later.

This continued the whole of the flight. Anything asked of them seemed too much trouble food was awful and was practically thrown at us. Seating was so uncomfortable cramped together but the worst part was as we were coming into land at Newark the pilot overshot the runway had to pull back up very fast and circle to try again it all happened so fast - it was so scary but not one of the crew checked on any of us passengers one lady got up to be sick in the toilet - all we had was a female cabin crew shouting for her to get out of the toilet and sit down. A child around 9 yrs of age was beside himself but still no one came to check on us. We got down safely the second time after being told they were moving to another runway. But even after the plane got down safely not one of the crew came to see if anyone needed any help. The passengers are supposed to come first but in this instance none of us were. Wouldnt recommend this airline to anyone and will never fly with them again.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,2,,,1,0

Slept at a nice hotel at ORD. Because of the low price for they tried to put us on a non direct fight for Washington and then to SFO.

When we landed in Chicago I received a text message from United Airlines that our connecting flight was canceled. They rescheduled us for 14 hours later! We live 2 1/2 hours away so we rented a car and drove. Our reimbursement was 1/4 the cost didn't even cover the car rental. No other mode of transportation was offered neither was a compensation for food or hotel if we had chose to stay and wait the 14 hours. This apparently happens very often. No excuse but they don't have a problem stealing your money and not giving anything in return. This company should not be allowed to run their business this way.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Z Harris,United States,5/16/2014,This was the worst travel experience I have had. I travel frequently for work and for leisure but this time I am unable to do either. I was scheduled to take off from LAX connect in ORD and then push on to ROC. Halfway through my first flight we were dropped down in Denver due to a closing at the ORD airport. They de-boarded re-boarded de-boarded re-boarded then de-boarded again. We were there for an excess of 4 hours standing in excessive lines awaiting information about connecting flights and possible re-bookings. It seemed like all the United agents were hiding! I was finally cleared to take off for Chicago and put on standby for 2 later flights to ROC. We were stalled on the runway at ORD and arrived at the gate very late. When I went to find my next flight it had been moved. No notification was sent to me but the agent ensured that it was boarding at another gate. I arrived at the new gate stood in line for 15 minutes to find out that all those flights were canceled. When I expressed my concern about missing work the next day I was barrated by the agent as he walked away from the desk and left me standing there without an answer. Thankfully I was automatically re booked for the next day but not given any accommodation. I stood in a customer service line for 2.5 hours to discuss accommodations with an agent. When I finally got to the front of the line I was told it was due to weather and I would not be accommodated. I told the agent that it wasn't weather that it was an excessively delayed flight that caused me to miss my connecting flights. He then handed me a bag of toiletries and suggested I find a hotel on my own and ushered me aside. By the time I walked away from the line it was 12:00 am and every hotel I called was booked. I am now sitting awaiting my flight to ROC and it too has been moved from gate to gate without proper notification. I was told to watch the monitors until my flight takes off. I also just found out that my flight will be delayed again. I now understand why United is suffering; their customer service is the worst I have ever encountered. I don't recommend ever flying with this company. Rates are reasonable but it is most certainly not worth the hassle.,,,Economy,,1,2,1,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,H Darwent,United Kingdom,5/16/2014,Travelled from Manchester UK to Newark then onwards to Las Vegas. Was very apprehensive after reading some dreadful reviews of UA. Became more apprehensive when attempting online check in 24hrs before the flight - our two seats were not together which for a long flight was a concern. After trying to finalise online check in I received an error message informing me online checkin hadn't worked. Arrived at Manchester and told that unlikely we'd get seats together in fact the flight full so although we had seats they were yet to be allocated & we'd need to wait for further instructions at the boarding gate. Luckily somehow we went from having seats apart to having no seats to somehow having an upgrade to Economy Plus! No idea how on a full flight we managed this but was great. Fantastic legroom (would pay extra on long haul now I know how much better the legroom. Food very good eggplant lasagne was lovely. Inflight entertainment was very good. Flights ahead of time. Internal flight between Newark & Las Vegas fairly standard neither good nor bad. Found direct comparison between Economy Plus & Economy legroom! No free food offered on the 5hr internal flight although available to purchase. Overall was very pleased with the flights however unsure I'd want a repeat of the apprehension again wondering if we had seats never mind sitting together! I'm scoring high for what we received but unsure I'd travel with them again as could so easily have turned out badly & also couldn't recommend to friends in case they have the nerves I had in advance and at the airport caused by UA procedure FOR online checkin/not allocating seats/together.,,,Premium Economy,,8,4,4,4,5,,,4,1

Late check-in at Reno (my fault) and the ground staff helped to rush me through and make the flight all with a positive attitude and was greeted upon boarding the plane. Each flight was about 85% full so not packed in. Leg room was just fine on the A320 B757 and EMB175. All attendants pleasant with just enough drink runs on each flight. All beverages were free including spirits. This was in economy! Arrived on time in Louisville more than happy with my day flying across country on three different flights. Plus my luggage made it.

Twice we took off from Denver and both times we were re-routed back. The only information we got was a two second message from the pilot that we were going back. We were completely on our own to find out what we were supposed to do. None of the United employees were at all helpful and are very disengaged at this airport and it seems like you are bothering them if you ask a question. After standing in the customer service line to re-book I was told no flights for two days. The customer service lady did seem to care and spent half an hour looking for alternatives.

Traveled with baby staff very inattentive and almost ignored our requests even as simple as asking for some water (to make baby food). When water was brought this was done with no empathy and not asking if there was something else they could do. Any question was first met by unfriendly looks. United's ground service at EWR was a catastrophe. There are electronic check-in counters about 20 with max. 3 staff to put the luggage onto the conveyor belt or to help if something can't be done through the user's interface the computer tells you to 'wait for staff to help you' we waited for more than 20 minutes.,,,Economy,,1,2,1,2,3,,,1,0

Believe it or not flying United we actually had a fairly decent experience. Yes the seats in coach are tight and uncomfortable. But at least 2 of the 4 flights left on time. Both flights to PV were on time and landed a bit ahead of schedule. We weren't so lucky on our return flights. The flight out of PV was delayed about a half hour because our plane arrived late. The flight out of Houston was delayed about 90 minutes but wasn't United's fault. There were many storms in Texas that night especially in Austin where our plane was coming from. So again the delay was not the fault of United. When we finally did leave we hit a lot of turbulence but that was expected due to the weather. All in all United did OK. Other then a few of their complimentary drinks that's all we had on the plane. We refuse to pay for airline food. Not once on any flight did either my wife or myself use the bathroom.

We arrived at our international destination 12 hours later than the original arrival time. Since that was mainly due to weather I can't blame United. On the way home though we had a terrible experience. Our final flight from Houston to Fayetteville was supposed to board at 6.45pm but they kept delaying it around every half hour until finally at midnight they canceled the flight entirely. There were no more flights going out that night and the next day's flights to our destination were completely booked. We were given vouchers for a hotel which we got to at 2.30am and vouchers for food for the next day at the airport. We had to book a flight to Tulsa where our family had to drive a long way to pick us up. This plane was also delayed for an hour for no apparent reason. Upon reaching Tulsa we discovered our luggage had been separated and my bag was sent to our original destination while my husband's stayed back in Houston airport.

The price was good but we were not allowed enough time between connecting flights. My husband is in a wheelchair and I appreciate the skycaps who managed to get us to the connecting flights although it almost killed me at 65 to have to get through the airport with our luggage. The biggest mishap was that when we arrived in Los Angeles from Las Vegas we were told there was no room for our carry on luggage so it was checked. My husband's bag went to Hawaii. After many days of talking to people on the phone who obviously have a problem understanding English we finally got his bag delivered.

I have paid for comfort seats on KLM and WestJet and they were so worth it. This airline - expensive and the only thing you get is slightly more leg room. The same uncomfortable seat in all other ways. This airline has to have the worst service of all airlines in the G20 (sorry have not flown others). Terrible seats extra cost for luggage what food is available is awful and expensive and now you have to pay for inflight entertainment. On a recent flight to Hawaii at least they had the courtesy of telling us not to bother because the inflight entertainment did not work over the ocean anyway.

No explanation nothing. Trite meaningless apologies are given. That's it. On my return trip the flight attendants were not very attentive in business. Once beverages were served at the beginning of the flight they disappear for the rest of the flight. The dinner meal for a 5.5 hour flight in business is a joke. A small plate of antipasto? That's an appetizer. The customer care program definitely needs improvement. Non responsive and when they do respond they ignore my complaint but do dwell on how great United is and they sincerely hope my next flight will be a good experience.

Since we booked with Lufthansa and paid regular prices and not with a cheap aircraft carrier this behaviour was outrageous! After we finally got our prints (just flight confirmations not boarding cards) we were told we would get the boarding passes at the gate.

I then asked if I did accept the flight for the next day would I be given a hotel room for the night his response was no because if the flight is cancelled due to weather then the airline is not at fault and does not have to provide a room. To put the cherry on top he would not look for other flights except for the one for the next day. His suggestion was that I researched possible routes home and come speak to him later when I found another flight that was more acceptable to me. I was at a loss. I managed to acquire a flight home that same afternoon to Toronto on Air Canada. What I want to know is how is the weather in Toronto can be a problem for United airlines but not a problem for every other airline in North America. I fly several times a year I will never fly with United Airlines again.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,H Robertson,United States,5/1/2014,"I flew from BTV-EWR-DFW a few months ago and it was by far the worst experience. Outbound flight to EWR was delayed 1 hour 15 minutes. The connection in EWR was missed by about 3 minutes. The customer service agent was useless and also put the blame on myself for missing the connection. I waited about 5.5 hours in what has to have been the dingiest terminal in the US (Newark's C2 concourse) for the next flight to DFW which of course was delayed. Once boarded we sat at the gate for an additional 40 minutes without any communication from the crew. The pilot then informed us that ""it appears the people refuelling this thing put more in the right wing than they did in the left"". We waited yet another 20 minutes for him to come back and say ""to add insult to injury it appears that the APU is broken and it wouldn't be a good idea to fly without it."" An hour has passed since we boarded and we finally pushed back. The inflight service was sub-par and only one beverage service was offered during the 3.5 hour flight. Overall an appalling experience on an airline that used to be enjoyable. Also if you're not flying international or a hub to hub expect a regional jet or prop plane.",,,Premium Economy,,1,2,1,1,1,,,1,0

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,McGuire Jack,United States,5/1/2014,MSY-EWR-LIS with an open-jaw return from LHR-EWR-MSY. I must confess I tempted fate here as I didn't want to leave New Orleans too early on a Sunday so I opted for the afternoon flight that would connect in Newark with the overnight flight to Lisbon. It was a short connection window (59 minutes) but I decided to risk it. Big mistake. Once we landed - wouldn't you know it - no available gate. So we waited an additional 40 minutes on the tarmac and then another 10 at the gate waiting for someone to operate the jetway to dock with the plane. I sprint off the plane and we were the last two people on the Lisbon flight. As it turns out that flight was delayed about 25 minutes. Our luggage wasn't so fortunate. When we initially inquired upon arrival in Lisbon they said it had been sent to Frankfurt and that it would be arriving on a TAP Air flight from Frankfurt at 3.25 that afternoon after which it would be delivered to us at our hotel. We left Lisbon the next morning and checked at the airport to see where our luggage was. No idea they said - the last reported location of the bags was Frankfurt. Off we flew to Paris - without luggage. Arriving at Paris-Orly (where there is no United presence) the only help we got was from a French ground services attendant who was nice enough and took our information as to where we were staying (in Normandy) but could offer little else. We spent the next 3 nights in Normandy with no luggage and no one attempted to contact us about it. Four days later finally someone from United got a hold of us and told us our luggage had arrived at London Heathrow. Since that was our final night of the trip we just opted to pick it up at the airport the next morning upon check-in and change at the airport lest we go through the hassle of yet another botched bag delivery. Only when we arrived at LHR we were told that our bags were already sent ahead to Newark on an earlier BA flight. So here we were - at the conclusion of an 8-day trip with no luggage. At least we'd be able to collect our bags once we arrived back home in New Orleans. Our bags never made it from Newark that evening. They'd come the next day they said. Finally at 2 in the afternoon almost nine days after I'd checked in the bag I was reunited with it. In one generation United has gone from industry standard to mediocre to absolute lowest common denominator.,,,Economy,,2,1,1,2,2,,,1,0

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Sean Terrell,United States,4/28/2014,My wife our 10 month old and myself flew from Columbus Ohio to Richmond VA with a stop in Cleveland. Our plane was late getting into Columbus which made us late for our connection in Cleveland. The next available flight wasn't until 8pm that evening giving us a 9 hour layover in Cleveland and causing us to miss the wedding rehearsal dinner we had planned on attending that evening. However when we reached our destination nearly 10hrs from our original arrival time we found that our luggage was lost. We received the same explanation from customer service while our bags flew from Cleveland to Charlotte to who knows where. On our last evening in Richmond a few short hrs from our next departure time and at 2am in the morning the doorbell rang and our luggage appeared for which I then had to pay another $25 to get it back on the plane for our return trip to Columbus. Just when things couldn't get any worse the ticket attendant at Richmond airport told me that my wife and infant's son were on the same ticket and my wife wouldn't need her own to get through security. We stopped and grabbed some coffee said goodbye to our in laws and stood in line to get through security. Once we reached the front of the line the TSA agent told my wife she needed to return to the ticket counter in order to get her own boarding pass. Unbelievable. So we returned to the ticket counter where the attendant who originally issued us our boarding passes proceeded to tell me it was my fault and my wife's name was not showing up on the reservation. Then mysteriously she found her name and printed the correct boarding pass. Once we got through security and to the gate the gate attendant made a snide comment about being the last one's on the plane and charged us another $25 to gate check our carry on bag-the same bag we carried on for free 3 days earlier. I realize United might have slightly cheaper airline tickets but please do yourself a favor and spend an extra few bucks to fly in peace with all of your luggage. In the end our lost bags cost us an extra 200-300 hundred dollars anyway and the service we received in Richmond was absolutely terrible.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

United tried to re-book us on a flight 24 hours later and only after considerable effort did they find us seats on a (half empty) BA departure. EWR-HR: Flight was overbooked so without asking us we were ""upgraded"" to Ec. Plus. The net result of which was I lost my aisle seat for a middle. I would have preferred to stay in Ec but was not consulted before being moved. The check-in staff at both LHR and EWR are easily the rudest I have ever come across.

We flew from Toronto connecting in Chicago and ending up in New Orleans. First they were an hour late taking off. The pilot said they were contracting out the baggage handling so they were slowly putting one bag at a time on the conveyor. As a result we missed the connection in Chicago. Then 3 (or 4 - I lost count) gate changes and delays. The we boarded then de-boarded. They didn't want to assign seats for 3 of our party even though I had bought and paid for the flights 11 months before they over-book and weren't sure 3 of us would make the flight. Finally arrived in New Orleans 6 hours later than scheduled. Of course we weren't seated together. Return flight - one of our party didn't get a seat at all.

Upgraded both international legs to economy Plus - makes a world of difference. Staff on Board were very welcoming (not OTT but very professional). Only gripe was that after a late Arrival NY-SFO it was announced that for those connecting to Sydney Australia that plane was being held (there were about 10 of us) and that we needed to proceed to International Gate 102. We all arrived there as quick as possible only to be told the plane was not going to wait and never was. The delay ex NY was not a UA issue - ground staff at Newark. Anyway - proceeded back to Customer Service desk where a fantastic attendant was very helpful provided us with a comp at the Crown Plaza near Airport and gave us some comfort packs.

They then directed us to go all the way back across the Airport to get lower quality and separate seats on a much later flight.

Inflight entertainment consistent of overhead screens with 80's image quality. Can't remember when I last sat in a plane with such prehistoric inflight entertainment. The worst were the stewardesses. Not all of them. But some of them were really unfriendly. The highest level of service that one older grumpy stewardess could muster during a 10 hour flight was to tell me that I had been standing at the back of the plane for too long (I was reading a book standing up couldn't bear sitting in the seat anymore) and I needed to sit down.

Food and drink service was the same (not much) so can't recommend this. No personal entertainment (was all on the big screen). Food was not good and seems to be deteriorating no longer do they give you any fruit or vegetables but just one course meal and that is it. I also noticed they now charge you for a beer or wine I think they just changed this as of January 2014? I paid an embarrassing $6 for a Heineken which I thought used to be included for Economy Plus? Service was just ok and nothing special. I then flew from ORD to IAD and again Economy Plus but waste of money.

My 11 year old wasn't even allocated a seat regardless how many times we tried online prior to flying and we booked last June. After a lot of stress got a seat but not together. They over book all flights and offer people compensation if they take another flight. Or offer you an upgrade to get all seats together as they tried with us for an extra££80 each. As someone said to us on the flight was that they are only after money. As regards to check in at Heathrow. What a mess. All electronic to get boarding passes. It was like a bun fight. United make a big thing about there new systems and app but have forgotten the most important thing. The customer. Luggage. Make sure each bag is under weight. As they don't take into account overall weight. Tried to charge us £150 for 1 bag over by 2 lbs. We transferred it to a lighter bag. As I said before only interested in the money.

I pointed out that I was flying global first 3 times and then demanded that we ask the people inside who said I was of course welcome. After heading into the lounge which at EWR is only a United club not first I went to the gate which was chaotic. They called global services group 1 and I came in behind the one GS person in group 1. I was actually pulled out of line and held back because they said only global services. I asked about global first and group 1 which was being called and was promptly told first class is very different from global services.

My flight from Narita to Newark Liberty was on a 777 that needs repairs and a good cleaning. My seat controls weren't working properly and the lavatories were dirty. Absolutely no amenities in the lavatories. I asked the flight staff for some soap and she gave me her own bacteria spray! For the cost of a business class ticket on this international flight you would think that United would provide what is standard on other airlines. The food was mediocre and no longer worthy of a business first pricing. All my other flights to Asia and around Asia were with Asiana and Bangkok Air. Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines. I took several 45 minute flights on Bangkok Air and would you believe they provided box breakfast/lunch with soft drink on each flight at no extra charge.

In practice these can never be used on these flights in my experience and one has to pay extra to be ""eligible"" then does not get the upgrade anyway. I am trying to book a ticket now and even though 38/40 business class seats are empty they will not confirm the upgrade and from what one reads on the internet the only way to get it is to check again and again and again and perhaps you might get lucky when they have opened one.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,L Grand,United States,4/13/2014,We flew from LAX to Dublin Ireland. I will never fly United again. The plane looked old it was also dirty. The drink service took forever! I realized it was because when you order a soda they don't give you a cup of ice and the can anymore. No. They now open a can a pour some into the cup for you and then use the same can for the next passenger. I've never had an airline do this. Very cheap. The worst part was the food. I am a vegetarian. When I booked the flight and went online to request a vegetarian option the only option I saw was Indian food. I highly dislike Indian food so I thought this was odd. I called customer service to inquire about other vegetarian options. They have no satisfactory options for vegetarians. I told her I would stick with the regular meal instead my plan was to eat the sides. When the meal service came around they brought me the Indian vegan plate! I told them that I did not request this and asked for a regular meal. They said they did not have enough and maybe once they served everyone if there was an extra I could have it. I didn't eat on the way to Ireland. On the way back I had to make sure to bring food for me to eat on the plane. Both flights to and from were delayed by 2+ hours.,,,Premium Economy,,1,2,1,1,3,,,1,0

After takeoff it became necessary for me to change my daughter's diaper. I pressed the flight attendant button and told the man that I needed to utilize the restroom with my daughter but since the lavatory was so small it was impossible to bring my 3 year old son with me. I asked if he could keep an eye on him just to ensure he stayed seated. I was told very tersely that this was not his job and he couldn't possibly do such a thing. I tried contacting United and got the following response ""The flight attendants are not required to assist with these type of activities it is strictly up to the flight attendants."" If you offer no assistance for people traveling alone with multiple children perhaps you should make your customers aware of your flight attendants utter uselessness before they board a plane assuming they will be treated as valued customers.",,,Economy,,1,1,1,2,1,,,1,0

In fact both flights were easy to check in with no surprises boarded in an orderly way pushed early the crew were friendly the meal on the 777 from LA to London was tasty the entertainment options on the 777 were diverse and well chosen (and no tedious pre-roll ads before the movies) and my bags were on the carousel promptly. Couldn't ask for more so they're off my no-fly list and fingers crossed for a few more flights like this.

After waiting until almost all other flights from the airport were gone for the night our flight was canceled. We were sent to customer service where things were even worse. Told we would have to stay in Denver until late the next day or even until 2 days from then. I was able to find flights the next day on many other airlines but they would not allow. We then decided to driver home from Denver Co to Madison WI (15 hours) with two young kids.

The plane leaves at 9:20 am in the morning. The 767-400 was recently updated with the new sleeper seats. The plane was clean and very comfortable. The entertainment system was excellent. The crew were efficient and nice. The really surprising disappointment was the food. A breakfast was served shortly after take-off but after that there was nothing except some doughy concoction that was served an hour before landing. The paucity of food and food service was stunning. Most other airlines serve Mai Tais on flights to Hawaii but not on United. I might as well have been on a flight to Cleveland.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,M Schultz,United States,4/1/2014,"I was a loyal and frequent Continental flyer for a number of years. All airlines have problems and cause the passengers problems. Continental was not an exception. However I was generally pleased with the aircraft (the newest of fleets) and with service. I recall having been delayed at AUS on a trip to LHR via IAH with my wife. We arrived at IAH with only 3 minutes to spare. We were met with a cart and our passports were checked and tickets issued as we sped along. All that ended with the UAL merger. I got caught in FRA with the merger mess on ""the"" day and since then it has been a series of canceled and long delayed flights with missed connections and very old and ragged aircraft. Most recently I tried to fly AUS to LAX on a CRJ in First. The attendant grabbed my suit coat and started stuffing it in an overhead bin. I objected as I was to go straight into a meeting. Seems the closet had been removed for an additional rows of seats. We were delayed for de-icing then for a malfunctioning APU. Finally at the 2+ hour point we returned to the gate and I deplaned making an AA flight in time. I suspect this is my last UAL attempt. Too unreliable.",,,First Class,,1,2,2,1,1,,,3,0

I flew UA123 which was a B757-200. This was an old plane but it had great AVOD and leg space and the staff were friendly. The flight was also early and very empty which is always a plus. The connections were typical subsidiary small airline service; nothing special nothing bad and on time. On my return from Washington our B777-2000 was delayed due to a fuel problem however the entertainment system was left on so we could finish our film. After a 45min delay the plane left and made up the time coming back across the Atlantic. This plane was half-empty and had been recently refurbished with a great AVOD system and spacious seating.

It was after landing in Newark that everything went wrong. Starting with the long immigration lines that wound around and around. My connection was scheduled to depart at 1.17pm and I was still at immigration at 1.10 even after enquiring about help from a United representative who was standing talking to a fellow colleague. She told me to join the line and when I ask what happened if I missed my connection she just tersely answered they will rebook you and walked away. At baggage claim there was no sign of my bag I was told to catch the flight and look for my bag in Fort Lauderdale. I finally got seated without a welcome or assistance from the two attendants standing at the door. We sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours. In the meantime however the empty seats started filling up little by little and I began to wonder if they were not just awaiting a fill to capacity flight. Not offered anything to eat. They gave us tea coffee or water and that was it. Needless to say that when I go to Fort Lauderdale my checked baggage was not there and was told it had been left in Newark and would be arriving on the 11pm flight.

Whole flight experience a bit of a revelation for me as I am used to flying Asian and European carriers. It was a bit like flying a short-hop domestic flight in UK - nothing much really to keep you happy while you are stuck in your seat. Maybe UA treat international flights like their domestic US ones. Even the announcements were the worst I have come across.

A request for two drinks met by a terse response of ""We do more than one drink service this is United!"" Hugely oversized carry on bags allowed in the cabin. As a result the last few passengers to board are separated from their carry-ons and ordered to relinquish them even if they are of legal size. Purchased a roast beef sandwich on the 4.5 hour BOS-IAH leg it was tiny soggy and disgusting. On the 5 hour IAH-YVR sector departing at 2100 no hot items for purchase just snack boxes with cheese and crackers. I don't believe that United is any different to any other US airline these days.

They even came around with trays of cups with water every so often. Second flight back (HKG to MCO) was a disaster. First flight from HKG to Newark was delayed 2 hours. Not a big deal we still had time to make our connecting flight. However the plane was further delayed by another 1.5 hrs after we were already on it. The crew were extremely rude. After 6 hours of no water my husband asked if we could refill my water bottle same as the first flight but this time they looked at him like he was crazy and said they were about to bring the drink cart around so to just wait for that. By the time we finally touched down in Newark we missed our connecting flight so had to be put on one 4 hours later. Again that flight from Newark to MCO was delayed. Instead of leaving at 9pm as scheduled we took off from the runway at 11pm after waiting 2 hours on the plane. One of the bathrooms was not functioning properly. They made an announcement that they weren't going to fix the bathroom but had to fill out paperwork anyway so we'd be off the ground as soon as paperwork was finished. Next thing we know a guy is coming down the aisle and starts fixing the bathroom. Then we had to wait for him to fix it before we took off.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,A Rosen,United States,3/18/2014,March 8th 2014 myself and 6 family members and friends were scheduled to fly at 3.15pm from Punta Cana to Newark. Of course the usual 45 minute delay in boarding was to be expected but by the time we got onto the tarmac and boarded the plane there was additional 2 hour delay. Finally by 9pm 6 hours after we were supposed to depart we were told the flight was canceled and would be rebooked the following day on flight 1762 at 2.20pm. Back through customs back to pickup up our luggage and then most of the passengers went onto a bus to a hotel to be returned the next day where the process was started again. 2 more hours to repeat check-in of luggage security and immigration. To add insult to injury United canceled another scheduled flight on Sunday and stranded 200 other customers so we could fly out. Boarding in the 90-degree heat they revealed to us that there were new mechanical problems with the replacement plane. They delivered us back to the terminal where we sat like cattle again without any information at all. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had in 40 years of traveling. United airlines gave only an empty apology by text message on our arrival in Newark referring us to a website to claim a minor token gift which could never compensate us for disastrously poor customer service. The 2 lost luggage bags that arrived 24 hours after we arrived in Punta Cana the week before seemed almost trivial in comparison. What a shame!,,,Economy,,1,3,5,2,2,,,1,0
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,D Graubard,United States,3/17/2014,YQB-ORD on 13 March. One reason for such low rankings is that I never actually ended up on a UA plane. Scheduled to fly out on the non-stop from Quebec City to O'Hare at 8am. The day before UA emails me that the flight is cancelled and they put me on a flight at 11.50am via EWR. Nope - not on United. Online showed the plane from EWR on-time into YQB but it never landed. Around 11.30 am the departure board shows a 3 hour delay for departure. There is not a single UA rep at the gate - and no one ever shows up to tell people what is going on. The pilots and flight attendant who are to work the trip to EWR didn't have any idea and were embarrassed that one heard it was a mechanical problem while the other heard it was weather. Every other airline into YQB was operating on-time or with 10-15 min delays due to snow in Quebec - all but United. I spent over an hour on the phone with my corporate travel trying to get on another flight - the first United agent wouldn't help my travel agent so she called back and got someone else willing to help. I ended up on Air Canada to YUL and then to ORD. Air Canada was fantastic! United - what is wrong with you? I never say never but unless it is mandated I fly on UA I won't do it. I was Platinum with them last year and Gold this year but I'll stick with American or Air Canada.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,3,0

The new round of checks on size of carry on is being handled in a way that has convinced me that I should never fly United again. While my bag was not over the size the agents take joy in making you size it and have the ""got you"" attitude. I am convinced the lack of space in carry on bins will no longer be a problem because any business traveler or preferred customer will have enough sense to fly with another airline.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Michael Fenn,United Kingdom,3/17/2014,Birmingham (BHX) to West Palm Beach (PBI) via Newark (EWR) Business Class. Outbound 25 Feb Inbound 10/11 Mar. Reading some of the reviews about United it would seem to be an airline to avoid however as it flies from my local airport I am more than happy to fly with them. The flights listed above all departed on time or within 10 minutes of schedule all arrived early allowing for hassle free connections. The service by both check in staff and onboard staff was perfect a lot of passenger complaints for this airline relate to staff attitudes well the attitude question works both ways some passengers are downright rude to check in and cabin crew. I have one or two gripes about the flights I am amazed at what is allowed on board as hand luggage are these people so important that saving a few minutes by missing baggage reclaim is of paramount importance to them. The entertainment system was not fully functional on the international legs. All in all the whole experience was a pleasant one I would recommend this airline for people in the West Midlands flying to the US albeit travelling in Business makes a difference but the premium economy and economy cabin looked to be ok as well.,,,Business Class,,10,5,5,4,3,,,4,1
united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,M Kunkel,United States,3/17/2014,On return flight to Denver plane waits for 15 minutes at DIA as ground crew is on break and between shifts even though docking space is open and available for our plane. The one checked bag I had on a direct flight from Calgary did not make the plane even though I arrived for check in at Calgary in plenty of time. As this was a small United plane it was oversold. With so many carry ons checked in below I and multiple other passengers had their luggage shifted to another plane. After waiting at the baggage carousel for 30 plus minutes all 3 lost baggage claim stations at DIA were unattended on a Sunday afternoon for over 30 minutes. When staff finally sashayed out the baggage reps stood for several minutes behind their computers talking to no one. The last 6 United flights in the past year that I and my family have taken have all resulted in some form of delays lost luggage or rude staff.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,R de Haan,Canada,3/17/2014,Travelled to Mexico with a family of 5. United changed our flight to Mexico at the last minute causing our arrival to be over an hour later almost negating our travel to our resort. The morning of our return I received email confirmation indicating that our connecting flight from Newark to Syracuse was cancelled. During several hours of trying to reach them and receive a new flight to get home we were finally told that we would have to stay in Newark until the next available flight. Our flight from Cancun to Newark we wanted the inflight entertainment and wanted to pay for 3 screens. Between the armrest functions not working or the unit not recognizing cards we were only able to get one screen to work. My seat was actually broken and kept reclining back on its own. When we arrived in Newark on Wed March 12 2014 we were advised that we would be able to come to that airport to standby over the next few days in order to get one or two out at a time. We are a family of 5 with two daughters. We then were told that we could fly out on the 17th of March 5 nights later at our own expense. The cancellation 13 hours before was apparently for weather but when we landed the weather was a little bit of rain. We ended up renting a vehicle one way to Syracuse from National and a 4 hour drive later we were in Syracuse. I have flown United before without issue and were extremely disappointed with the airline on this trip. I will not be flying United next vacation that is for sure.,,,Economy,,3,1,3,1,1,,,2,0

Was prepared for a steerage experience on UA but felt the economy seat was surprisingly comfortable and the dinner ok as well.

Return flight from Nashville to Houston was cancelled and the robot computer rebooked my for 5.40am the next morning. All flights on original travel date were overbooked. Got to Nashville Airport and half of UA's Expressjet flights were cancelled or delayed. Every gate had the wrong flight posted and they reshuffled right before departure.

Left the restaurant 30 mins before boarding when we go to the flight screens we had seen that it said cancelled we did not understand why? Told that the crew had not shown up and that there were no other flights available meaning we were stuck in Chicago until the next morning. 5am wake up to catch the new flight they had scheduled us on. Got to the agent at our gate and saw the agents panicking told it would take 30 minutes to get the problem sorted.

Waited all day to get on a standby flight (7 that went through that day all over booked) - would have been bumped from the 11 pm flight they rescheduled me on (after bumping me in the am) had I not checked to make sure I was ""guaranteed"" on the flight. Make sure that when you check in your ticket has a seat assignment - if it says ""see agent"" make sure you go early and hopefully get it taken care off - What a terrible disregard for peoples time from United.

I haven't flown them on an international flight since the late 90's. It was a bad experience then my latest trip was even worse. If you're looking for bad seats bad meals people who hate their jobs then this is your airline. They charged me an extra fee of $100 (USD) for my extra check in bag. I had to pay high prices for any drinks with alcohol on an International flight. They flew us home (9 hour transpacific flight from Tokyo) with a fixed cabin TV screen.

All flights out of Columbus and Hartford have a very poor on-time percentage around 40%. My return flight had been boarded with a broken air plane which led to everyone de-boarding and boarding a second plane. In return many people on the plane missed their connecting flights from the delay and had to be rebooked and stay at a hotel overnight including myself.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Eve Law,United States,3/10/2014,Flight from Midland to Salt Lake City was great. Both planes were small but that was fine. The crew were great and the reason I purchased the tickets was because it was the fastest flight. The layover was short and it was easy to find my next gate. We left and arrived on time. On my way back however totally different! I had a 6.20 flight and arrived at the airport at 4.30. The line for United Airlines was so long it extended the length of the terminal and out of the door. I stood in line for 1 hour and 20 minutes! No information given and the line did not move very quickly at all. Finally at 6 am a woman working for United started walking down the line asking if anyone was going on the 6.20 flight to IAH. Over 30 people left the line to stand in yet another line for an additional 10 minutes. No explanation was offered no apologies given. We were rushed through first class passenger line of security and I boarded the plane at 6:15 am. The plane was half full because everyone was still waiting in line. Our flight left at 6.45 because we had to wait on all the other passengers. The pilot did his best to make up time in the air and I made in time to make my connecting flight.

On the hop from Newark to Dulles I was surprised how noisy it was though I was close to the engines. United seem to call people forward now by group number as printed on there boarding pass as opposed to seat number blocks.

The coach cabin is a mess and even first class which I usually take is sub par. Last time I flew first class they gave me a hard time when I asked for milk for my toddler children!

Nice hard product but uninspiring service and meal. Overworked flight attendant working business class in the dome got the job done though.

Throughout the night we tried calling different customer service numbers of United and could not get a straightforward answer. 20 hours later our bags reached us.

Should be a quick fix that will take best case 30 minutes"". 10 minutes later we are told to deboard the plane because this ""quick fix problem"" has caused the plane to be completely out of service. As we all deboard our entire flight is told to go to one customer service desk with 4 representatives.

I thought it was pretty good. I paid extra for more legroom which was well worth the money. Cabin crew came through the cabin regularly offering water or juice on the JFK-LAX leg in particular. The seats are more comfortable than Qantas economy and likewise the entertainment was a bit better also. My biggest complaint is the amount of luggage/baggage United allow passengers to drag onto the plane. If you are Group 5 (aisle seats) and the last to board all the bins are full of people's stuff from seats away!

No inflight entertainment as WiFI was not working and the old school entertainment system had already been removed. In-Charge offered all passengers compensation through UA Website. Offer on the web site was $125 off the next UA Flight for US residents or 10% off next UA flight to be used within 1 year for international travellers. Dinner and breakfast were served. Quality of both meals were OK and reminded me of Y class meals from days gone by. Ice cream sundae cart made the rounds after dinner. First Class Attendants ensured beverages were topped up and one FA even made sure water glasses were topped up while passengers slept. Difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in recliner chairs. However the ticket price was reasonable for the passenger space offered on the aircraft. For an 8 hour overnight flight First class should offer flatbeds IMHO. UAL Express connector flight ORD-YWG ran 1 hour late due to off loading of baggage when connecting passengers failed to show.

I know problems can arise that are out of our control but maybe I am one of the lucky one's. United has always done right by me. I know if I board a plane with a smile and say hello I will get that right back. I don't always expect the flight crew to be lavishing over me in economy by any means.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,K Castle,United States,3/3/2014,Traveled to Denver from Rochester NY on United twice in the past month. Every plane had a mechanical problem resulting in having to re-book multiple flights because of missed connections. In January I sat on the Tarmac for 3 hours in Rochester because someone had forgotten to drain the water out and it took that long to de-ice. On my return flight from Denver I had to be re-booked 3 times due to mechanical issues and sat in the airport for 8 hours. The only reason I finally got out was because a connecting flight from Idaho landed too late and they refused to hold the plane. In my most recent flight out of Rochester in February the altimeter was broken and we waited 6 hours for parts to be flown in from Atlanta. Oh and - I had paid extra for aisle seats in Economy Plus and ended up in the middle seat in the back of the plane.

Now in addition to having to pay extra for a poor sandwich wrap they've got the gall to make you cough up extra to watch a movie. I object to paying for what is standard on other airlines. They take your money $1000-2000 and then expect you to pay for a movie - or even a flight map. Of course they'll say it's only $6-8 for DirecTV and provides access to many TV channels as well.",,,Economy,,1,2,2,1,1,,,1,0

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,M Bergner,United States,2/27/2014,My wife and 22 month old son are about to board a 14 hour flight. United is only offering one meal service over that 14 hour period and they won't give any food to my son because he's on his mothers lap and doesn't have his own individual ticket. Some milk maybe some yoghurt a ham sandwich costs them what maybe $2? It's apparent that that extra $2 is worth more than the comfort of their lowly economy customers.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,P Kim,United States,2/27/2014,"Terrible service unless you are some sort of elite status traveler. This airline wouldn't let me pick my seats during on-line check in. Assigned me and my 9 year old son Exit row seats because the flight was completely oversold. When I advised gate attendant that a 9 year old would be in the exit row they stated that I ""shouldn't have agreed to the terms and conditions of those seats"". Told to leave my boarding passes and they would fix it. After 40 minutes everyone else gets on plane I go up to find out what's going on and I'm then given back my original boarding passes and told to get on the plane and they would fix it there. Onboard told to see the 2nd attendant. The 2nd attendant tells me I can't sit in the exit row with a child. An attendant moved 2 people out of their seats into the exit row and then snidely says to me ""See. that wasn't so bad was it?"". I've taken 4 United round trips in the last 5 years and pretty much determined that this kind of attitude is common.",,,Economy,,1,3,1,2,3,,,2,0

Third was trying but seemed befuddled at multi-tasking thus often a step or two behind. Nice touch that rather than leave the mid flight option at the galley they did a more formalized service.

The United Club was unfortunate and so was the outdated 737-800 (UA1505) that took us to our Christmas vacation. Save your money folks and fly coach. This class of service is not worth the extra cost. I would say the worst part about flying United is the unenthusiastic and unhelpful service. No big surprise to anyone who flies United regularly. I also bought the Premier Accelerator and Reward Accelerator erroneously thinking that I would maintain my Status Match level with this flight. The ""fine print"" here is that the Accelerator is not permitted in achieving status if you're doing a Match but their web site will continually advertise it to you like it is.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,J Anderson,United Kingdom,2/25/2014,"Our last series of flights (from the UK to the USA and also within the USA) were quite simply the worst travel experience we have had in over 30 years of being regular international and national travellers. Staff in the business class lounge were unhelpful badly informed and unfriendly. Flight was delayed and we were initially held sitting on board for several hours. Then had to de-board and a few hours later the flight was cancelled. We had to exit through the baggage hall. Despite having a lot of baggage and having already been assured we could leave our checked baggage with United staff one member of staff told us ""we won't look after this anybody can take it and it's not our responsibility and then decided to insist we take our bags out immediately. The hotel United put us in was dreadful. Put on a fight the following day. We used air miles to upgrade to business class: United's configuration of the new extra-slim business class seats is awful. 2x4x2. Paying business class and being stuck in the middle with no dividers between two people you don't know? Hardly classy treatment! Seats are so thin that anyone with broad shoulders will be very uncomfortable. One of the internal flights in the USA was so cold that everyone sat shivering in their overcoats. At every airport in the USA staff were at best ungracious and unfriendly. Everything was too much trouble for them. United has also downgraded its Silver status so that now you only get one free bag not two.

Solved that with a pull out and then the fun started. Pilot came on and said we are rerouted and he doesn't have enough fuel but that he is protesting with the tower. Over an hour later we are at a gate being fuelled. The gate agent refused to assist me in finding another route home since 2 hours had passed and I was certain I'd missed my connection in SFO. No hotel because they said the delay was due to weather not incompetence. The new customer focus they speak of is a facade. Flight was Feb 21.

A gentleman came out of the gate off of a flight obviously in a hurry and quickly asked where the connecting flight for Newark was. The staff here looked at him like it was the most inconvenient question in the world. They closed the doors for the tarmac before all passengers were inside which left them outside knocking on the door. Not one member of the staff let them in so an airline customer opened the door which set off an alarm. Again the staff did nothing and let the alarm go off for minutes. Definitely not impressed not to mention every time the gal came over the loud speaker she sounded like se had no clue what was going on.

No entertainment system just some random loop of Olympic commercial. Flight attendants are organized and accommodating. Storage was a bit tricky and always a pain since all pax are not checking luggage so it gets full leg room is quite cramped even though I'm only 5'8''. Landing was good and was out the airport within 10 minutes. first leg was delayed 1 hour due to late turn around of the plane pilots were very informative throughout.

Total time should have been 6-7 hours. Problems started in Los Angeles when the gate person told us that there was a mechanical problem on the plane. Many people had connecting flights and so a long line formed. One person was at the desk creating new boarding passes. For some reason it took him about 10000 keystrokes to issue each pass. Two hours he issued a total of two boarding passes. The line became exceedingly long and then he called in a manager who whispered in his ear then left. Another associate came in talked to the associate at the counter and walked away. Flight arrives late and then I have to wait 7 hours for another flight to Boston. Total travel time ended up being over 17 hours. Horrible experience inept customer service.,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

Their website and mobile app are an atrocity then again the flights were absolutely fine. The 15+ years old B777s with refurbished 3-3-3 cabins are way more spacious than many of the newer planes though 31"" seat pitch in coach feels borderline cramped. IFE screens are tiny but the AVOD selection is downright impressive. Unlike previous trips the staff were courteous attentive and efficient. Even the meals were rather delicious as far as airline food goes. There was plenty of drinks throughout the flight frequent updates from the crew and we even cut down a 40min delay to an on-time arrival to FRA - altogether an enjoyable travel experience.",,,Economy,,8,3,5,5,5,,,5,1

Arrived into ORD more or less on time. Had 50 minutes to get to next gate which was miles away. Got to the gate with about 10 minutes to spare. 4/7 of my group members got seats. Three were put up in a hotel for the afternoon and the closest United could get them to FLL the same day was to fly to MEM. They arrived in MEM only having to drive 13 hours to get to FLL. They were fairly compensated that was the only good part of the outbound trip. On the way back check in was a breeze as it was deserted. Ended up getting to the gate with about 2 hours to spare. Plane was delayed about 25 minutes aggravating but didn't lose any sleep over it. Got into ORD a couple minutes late. My connection to YWG was supposed to be 40 minutes but our plane which was coming in from SAV was 4.5 hours late leaving thus delaying us 4.5 hours. I was insulted as we only received a $7 voucher. The only shop that was open was a McDonald's which was in the American Airlines terminal which was miles away.

Decent IFE and comfortable seat for the 5 hour flight. Cons: Too many to mention but mainly staff attitude about everything. Even the simplest task is completed with a sigh and a roll of the eyes. I've never experienced boarding a flight before while the crew talked amongst themselves and literally ignored passengers boarding - not even a request to show boarding passes. I've honestly never been tested with such consistent disdain by employees of a company to which I'm paying a considerable chunk of money. It got to the point where I just smiled to myself with amusement at their unprofessional and frankly useless and unhelpful manner.

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,A Davidson,Canada,2/20/2014,"This review relates to a 5 flight itinerary booked with United. Other than flight segment 3 which was with Lufthansa from Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC) the other 4 flights were with United Airlines. The problem started when United had a schedule change which did not allow us a legal connection in Newark (EWR) on the outbound flight to Barcelona (BCN). We received an e-mail from United informing us of a change in time to an earlier flight from Phoenix (PHX) to Newark (EWR) allowing us a legal connection for our flight. This in itself was a bit annoying since we went from an original connection time of one hour to a four hour connection. Unfortunately we ""accepted"" the change on-line which was the first error on our part. The day prior to departing from Phoenix we received the usual message telling us we could print our boarding passes. This worked fine until we checked the boarding passes only to find out there was no longer the priority boarding we had booked and paid for. This resulted in spending over an hour on the phone to United. As it turned out with every segment flown with United it was necessary to go through the whole process of having them reprint boarding passes which showed the priority boarding and then only after we had provided them with proof this had been purchased. As for the flights themselves? The usual experience of dealing with disinterested flight attendants barely edible food and the fact as I was told ""United no longer offers special meals (eg: low cholesterol or diabetic) but does provide a kosher meal for its Jewish and Muslim passengers and a beef free meal for its Sikh passengers. So all in all the poor service of United Airlines appears to be the norm more and more these days rather than the exception which really is a problem for the UA's promise that we are ""flying the friendly skies"".",,,Economy,,1,3,1,1,3,,,3,0

united-airlines,United Airlines customer review,Bar Artur,Poland,2/18/2014,I flew United on domestic US flights 3 times in last month and I am very disappointed by their customer care. They haven't informed passengers that due to delays their connection flight (on the same flight number as from Portland to Las Vegas through San Francisco) would be missed - they knew that before boarding the first plane. Secondly they ignored passengers who had to sleep at San Francisco airport on the floor having all restaurants and half of restrooms closed. When coming back from US to Poland (3 flights - 17 hours) I couldn't check an additional bag (as I should have Star Alliance Silver status) informing me that these were Lufthansa regulations and they have their own united and they don't care or I will have to pay 200$.

He took our tickets and forced us to stand by and wait for everyone else to board the plane every time we tried to ask him any questions he completely ignored and avoided us. After everyone else was on board he shoved some tickets at us and sent us on the plane with 4 small kids and 2 car seats. We were scattered throughout the plane. Fortunately the staff on the plane were accommodating enough to rearrange seating a little in order to get my husband or I as close as possible to our kids but we were still very separated. We also found out that several other families were separated on the plane as well. The entire flight was very stressful and unnerving and after this experience I will never fly with United again based on the treatment of the man at the gate.

To start we had a 5 hr delay and our party of 6 had to be split up and re-routed to reach our overseas destination (this was not due to weather). United offered us a measly 7$ credit that was only usable in one airport for food. It didn't even cover a meal. When we finally were on our way there were further delays (once again not weather) and upon arrival our party was split and we had to pt double to take the shuttle separately to our hotel.

To make matters worse my bags were lost. It would have taken them two hours to drive it to me instead they had to fly it back then ship it to the correct place.

Staff were extremely slow for simple bag check-ins as well as unfriendly and unprofessional. Flight was delayed 4 hours because the crew needed time off. Does US Airways only have one crew available? The flight finally got off the ground 4 hours and 45 minutes later than scheduled. Because I was just taking a day trip to Philadelphia to drop off someone who had a 10 hour layover it ended up being a waste of money for me. For my return flight from Philadelphia they announced that there would be a 10 minute delay because - you guessed it - they were short on personnel. The 10 minutes turned into over an hour before they could get a first officer and 2 flight attendants. The service on board on both flights was poor. The attendants were cold and impersonal. The gate personnel at Orlando were the absolute unfriendliest I have seen in over 45 years of flying. US Airways used to be a good airline that I enjoyed flying with, but since the fusion they are just a shadow of what they used to be and even worse than their partner American Airlines.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Michael J Barbosa,United States,7/19/2015,"Returning to LAX on family holiday trip from San Juan PR was a nightmare: Plane left late from SJU arrived at CLT (Charleston, NC) almost on time - but - plane sat on tarmac for 40 minutes, resulting in missed flight to LAX, last flight of the night. Rebooked for same flight - 24 hours later. No vouchers, no food coupons, no apologies. Delays were admittedly due to weather in CLT and air traffic control response, but given that trip was booked all legs through AA/US Airways, would have thought airline could hold last flight for connecting passengers known to be waiting on tarmac for gate to make connections. Many upset AA/US Airways passengers were in evidence at Charlotte ""International"" Airport. Additionally, rampant, repeated misinformation and; unhelpfulness from US Airways/American Airlines customer service and airport staff. Were told by airport staff at gate we could reclaim luggage at baggage claim - could not be more wrong, they would not ""pull bags"" so I, wife and 2 kids stuck in Charlotte for 24 hours. Moreover, had purchased $200 liquor in Duty Free in SJU, but, due to TSA regulations and because we left the secure area, have had to improvise and box bottles for check-through on rescheduled flight - another $25 fee too boot. Don't know if they'll let me check (am writing from a hotel near airport during my 24 hour ""layover""). Even better - flight crew was at baggage claim and unable to find accommodation for the night - so AA/US Airways not only jerking around customers but crew as well (not surprisingly). You'd think they'd have contingency plan for these sort of events as a rested flight crew is allegedly critical to FAA safety requirements, but they were in the same pickle as we - completely and utterly out of luck! Was loyal AA booster and flier for years, even enjoyed ""Sapphire"" status at one point, but will never fly AA/US Airways again if there is a-n-y other option.",A321,FamilyLeisure,Economy,SJU to LAX via CLT,1,3,2,1,1,1,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,L Johnson,United States,7/19/2015,"The check-in process was good, flight on time, comfortable seats. My major concern was the flight attendants we encountered. Out of four flights on this trip, we only had one attendant that we did not overhear complain about the airline. We sat in exit rows on all the flights, and in seats that allowed conversation with them. We specifically chose a window seat for one of our legs of the trip, but the flight attendant made a mistake and thought we were in the wrong seat because another passenger thought he had the window seat exit row. The attendant told us we were wrong, so we made the move per request, then quietly pointed out we had been in the correct seats all along. The attendant apologized, but didn't ask the other passenger to move to his ticketed seat. My husband had circulation problems, so we specifically wanted the seat we had requested as it allowed more leg room. When the beverage cart came by, we did ask for a complementary rum and coke to compensate us, which we did receive. I would have to think twice before flying with US Airways again.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Lauren Yearsley,United States,7/18/2015,"$25 for each checked bag is definitely a negative in my book. The flight itself should include your luggage fee. The way this airline does seating is entirely asinine - you can book your flight at any time, but you have to wait until within two weeks of the flight to actually pick your seats. The flight was very loud and the lights and air conditioners at each seat were difficult to adjust, at some points feeling as if they would break if you tried to point the air toward you. Snacks all have to be paid for rather than being included, which also seems ridiculous when the flight already costs so much. I probably will never voluntarily fly with US Airways (or American Airlines for that natter) in the future.

Despite telling them it was an international flight with a transfer connection and one party was on a wheelchair, they still insisted. The kiosk rejected my attempts, wasting about 20 minutes of my time. At check in, the staff were rude and insisted that my bags were over the weight limit despite travelling in on a business class ticket. Finally, she relented, printed off my boarding pass only to have it rejected by the TSA agent as the bar code was not printed properly. Then there was no one to push the wheelchair for my travelling partner so I took it upon myself to do so as they were closing the flight. I was told off by the check in agent for not arriving earlier but I pointed out that we had been there on time but wasted 20 minutes at the kiosk and another 20 minutes queuing to check in.

We were trying to leave BWI, when we got a phone call saying we were an hour delayed. Okay, it happens. Someone from the airline was checking the people with connecting flights to make sure they could still make it, he said we ""should"" make it. Well, we had a gut feeling ""should"" wasn't enough so we went to another counter. They said we would have to change our flight because we would only have 4 minutes to make it to a gate on the other side of the airport before the flight departed. We wouldn't have eaten calmly and taken our time to do things if we were told that to begin with! So they tell me we will have to stay an extra 5 hours sitting at the airport to our connecting flight or that we would have to pay for a hotel and stay the night in Charlotte, they wouldn't pay, but regardless I had to be in Charleston that night. So I asked to be refunded because it was not sounding like great options. There was a sweet lady that helped us and told us to let the flight attendant know we had to make our earlier flight as soon as we landed. However when we got onto the plane about 2 hours later, they delayed us another 30 minutes because of traffic. We wanted to leave, I would make it driving down south faster than flying (and a lot cheaper), but a nice lady on the plane saw how upset we were and helped calm us down. She then explained that we wouldn't be able to make it to our earlier flight, but that we could ask the help desk to get us seats on the 10:30 flight, or have the airline pay for our hotel to leave the next morning because the delay was due to ""maintenance"" issues. We had no choice so she met us as we landed and tried to help us find an airport nearby our original location for a friend to pick us up at. Her shift was over and was beyond sweet for helping us for so long. She actually found us a flight leaving 15 minutes after we landed but they wouldn't have been able to deliver our luggage. So we took the seats on the 10:30 flight and of course without sitting together (I get anxious so I always need someone, so my fiancé and I were upset). We sat there and of course, they say they have to change a tire that would take a bother 30 minutes. That whole trip ended up totaling 11 hours after delays, maintenance, and layover.

Finally a young lady got up and moved her laptop so I could place my bag in the overhead. While struggling to lift my bag a gentleman sitting in a seat got up and helped me. Meanwhile the steward and stewardess were still standing in their spots! When I sat down the steward told people to put away their computers. A man sitting across from me started putting his away when the steward came back yelling at him because his was not putting his away fast enough!

us-airways,US Airways customer review,L McKeown,Canada,6/24/2015,"On my way back to Canada, I chose to fly US Airways since I made a last minute booking and didnt feel like paying a full Y class fare on Air Canada. I usually fly Air Canada and Star Alliance Partners, so I chose US Airways based on them being a former partner. I was surprised, comparing the flight to Canadian airlines such as Air Canada and Westjet. The Seats were not at all what I would have expected, there was no IFE system on A319 or CRJ, but that was expected on the CRJ. Cabin Crew was very nice and pleasent. There was a complimentary Beverage service and a la carte snacks, However I found $4 US for a small pack of Pringles and $7US for a Tiny Bottle of Heineken a little steep. Seeing as this was a Domestic flight, I would understand the lack of IFE. There weren't any onboard power outlets on any aircraft. My Laptop died halfway through my flight to Philly. Safety Briefing was done by the flight crew but it seemed that they were tired of doing it. Not many were paying attention and I believe a safety video would be more effective.

Despite the fact that there were open seats on the earlier flight I was not permitted to change flights. As predicted, the thunderstorms arrived, delaying my flight 1.5 hours, forcing me to miss my connection. As a result, I had to stay in a hotel at my own expense and get up at 4am to get to the airport for my new flight. When I got to the airport it was buzzing with stranded travelers waiting to check in. The US Airways kiosks were useless because they only accept boarding passes. It was chaos.

How wrong could I have been. Boarded the 5 year old aircraft, an A330-200, on time and in an organised manner. Within 30 minutes crew came through with a drinks run. Wine and soft drinks free, with a fee for spirits. Lunch followed and was very tasty. Small salad, main chicken dish with a nice desert. Nothing spectacular but very edible for airplane food. The crew, all but one, seemed happy and cheerful and interacted with the passengers as they came through the cabin. They came through the cabin with another juice and water run about an hour later and after that we got an expected treat of chocolate ice cream. About an hour before landing in Charlotte we were given a tasty paninni snack and cupcake with an offer of another drink or tea or coffee.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,R Roden,United States,5/31/2015,Flew MSP-PHL-LHR-DUS and returned DUS-TXL-ORD-MSP. The flights were a disaster from start to finish. First flight delayed out of MSP for 25 minutes. Ok that's understandable. But when we arrive in Philadelphia we are told we will have a short wait until our gate is cleared. This turns into a very long wait and we are on a tight connection. We ask the flight attendant if she could please contact our next flight and ask them to wait. She rudely says no and then offers no further response. When we finally deplaned we asked the agent at the gate if she could please contact our flight. All she did was give us directions on getting to the B concourse. After a sprint to the gate we barely make it on the final boarding call. Thankfully the flight to London was only 25% occupied at most and we were able to stretch out. The flight to DUS was with British Airways and went smoothly except for a slight 10 minutes delay. On the return flight our flight was cancelled with no reason given. We were lucky we checked early and immediately called customer service. They said they couldn't put us on another flight for about 3 hours until they finally caved in and put us on a flight departing in a few hours with Air Berlin meaning we got no sleep.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,B Richardson,Netherlands,5/31/2015,I had a terrible experience with US Airways. I took them from Seattle to Amsterdam through Philadelphia. Here's what went wrong: They didn't provide me with a gluten-free meal for all 15+ hours of travel and did not apologize or make any effort to find me something from the reserves I had confirmed online and at both airports that I'd have something to eat and they confirmed both times. If I'd known I would have been irritated but at least I could have prepared! When I asked for water from the beverage cart they wouldn't give it to me because it came with the meal (which I never got) and when I finally got a crew member to stop she didn't answer me when I asked for water but came back 20 minutes later with some. The crew members were extremely hostile and rude. There was no entertainment whatsoever.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Ken Walsh,United Kingdom,5/25/2015,Yesterday I flew PHL to LHR on the day flight departing at 9.35am EST. This very tired old plane needs to be retired pronto as not competitive at all. Sat in row 1 with bulk head in front with a seat used typically from internal US flights not a standard transatlantic seat although seat card indicated being refitted previously plane felt in a sorry state. As I am tall the bulkhead prevented me from stretching legs out at reasonable angle you would normally expect - straight was not possible. Outbound flight to PHL from LHR was with BA and was usual solid service but this was shocking by comparison and not worthy of the fare at all (had this been a night flight I would have walked back off the plane in disgust and gone with any other airline). I urge nobody to pay for Business on this route if with American from Philly until they put the modern seats in. Entertainment is provided by a Samsung ipad like device - which is good but means you put it away when food comes they aslo take them all back way before we landed so did not get to finish two movies on a 6hr flight. Tray table can not come out and sit flat unless I am sat up right - this is a nuisance. I did not like the food one bit. I was at my most happy when I got off the late plane (late leaving as someone left passport in checked luggage resulting in waiting behind 17 planes to take off at PHL) - had sat in useless seat for 8+ hours as we were late.,,,First Class,,,1,3,2,1,,,1,0

Good value for money pleasant and engaged cabin crew and the special meal pre ordered on the transatlantic legs of the trip was quite good by today's airline standards. A nice touch on the outbound trip was a mid flight ice cream snack and the complementary wine with meals was also appreciated. Good selection on the Transatlantic IFE but surprisingly no IFE on the U.S. Domestic A321s. Quite a limited inflight menu on domestic flights not much healthy food on offer and by the time cabin crew reached us they were sold out of most food items. Return flight from LAX to PHL was diverted to Richmond due to ATC restrictions in PHL thankfully the DUB flight was held so when we eventually got to PHL we were able to make the connection which departed 1 hour 20 mins late.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,J Spinelli,United States,5/10/2015,My wife and I decided to travel to Anguilla for our honeymoon and booked our flight through US Airways. Being that it was our honeymoon I decided to call US Airways and find out the cost associated with upgrading our seats. However upon my conversation with the attendant was promptly made aware that the actual flights we were on had changed and our plane was now scheduled to depart and arrive at completely different times. Not only did they replan my arrival and departure times for me but they took it upon themselves to change my seats and not even assign me to two on my return flight. I am not going to say my honeymoon was ruined however when a merge causes a company to become so big they begin rearranging your plans it begins to make sense why they shouldn't happen. On a side note if we switched the situation and decided to change our flight instead we would be paying a $200 change fee and the difference in ticket price each. Not once were we offered an upgrade for the inconvenience or a partial refund for the change of flights which appear to be less expensive. I was previously a supporter of US Air however after learning that they can take it upon themselves to rearrange my honeymoon plans you can bet I am flying another airline for business moving forward.,,,Economy,,,2,1,1,0,,,2,0

Ok no worries we were scheduled on another flight to Denver 3 hours later. After waiting for almost 3 hours that flight was cancelled. No explanations just cancelled. The customer (dis)service person at the US Airways counter was rude arrogant and even threatened us with calling the police if we didn't leave the counter.

By this time I got on my iPad and booked a (surprisingly) cheap flight on another airline no fuss and we were on our way to Denver within the hour.

After several gate changes following a series of confusing announcements in an extremely overcrowded terminal the creeping delays started half an hour at the time. After an hour we were informed plane had landed but due to congestion there were no stands available. Finally boarding was announced at around 8.30pm after which it started to rain. We were then informed there would be a further delay due to the rain. We sat on the plane for an hour then taxied to the runway and waited another hour only to be informed that the flight would now be cancelled due to the weather. It was now after 10pm. On disembarking I was fortunate to be near the front so could be attended to quickly at the customer services desk for re-booking but I later realized others were stuck in a queue for hours late into the night. I was told flatly that all flights were full and overbooked until 10pm the next day. I was told rudely to 'take the 10pm flight or leave it' and as it was due to the weather it was not their responsibility to offer anything else (in fact the weather was just one of the contributing factors for the cancellation - the plane had already been late). I had to push and push to be offered alternative options (e.g. flights to a different airport or with layover etc). Eventually they found a flight via Philadelphia the next morning. I asked for more details and then agreed to be put on the flight only to be told I had taken too long to make a decision and now that flight was also full! I overheard other passengers being rebooked for other morning flights in adjoining desks so I have no idea what was going on.

When booking flights it asks if you are travelling with children which I was yet not one of the three adults that were travelling were able to sit with the child. When we land in Philadelphia we go directly to the gate so that there will be no worries of us missing our flight. The time comes when we should be starting to load the plane and my husband goes and asks when will be boarding and they inform him the gate has changed which they had not announced. Us along with most of the people sitting around us run to the new gate. When we arrive they there is a delay because they have to bring in a new plane once the new plane arrives they have to clean it after an hour they tell us there are problems with the plane.

When they do start to board the plane the lady starts yelling at everyone to hurry up like we were the reason for the plane being so late. The return flight comes around and I am thinking surely this time things will be better - wrong. We look at our tickets to see if by any chance we will have someone to sit with my son on any of the flights No. Then I notice that on one of the flights I do not have a seat number. I go to the counter and ask what does this mean and I am told I have to check at that airport when I arrive. I ask does this mean I will not be on the flights? Oh no you will be.

My wife's bag is not large but it does have rollers and it seemed they were ""confiscating"" every bag in Zone 5 with rollers. We boarded the aircraft and discovered there was loads of bin space. I approached the First Class Cabin attendant and said I'd like to retrieve my wife's bag he said ""no it's already gone."" I asked why they were telling passengers there wasn't any bin space when there clearly was plenty of space. He offered a ""well they don't actually check it's just that at about this time in boarding there isn't much space left."" On arrival in SFO we thought well at least as the last bag loaded it'll be the first one off the carousel again we were mistaken. At least 50 bags came off before our bag and not a quick 50 bags. We discovered on our return flight (we returned from San Jose Airport) the same protocol was used by the gate attendant. Our bag was the last carry on allowed all the others were collected and checked. We realized at that point since there was plenty of bin space again that this is a ""convenience"" move by US Air their convenience they don't risk a late ""push back"" if people are seated faster. Of course ""their convenience"" translates into ""our inconvenience."" Why not board 5 minutes earlier? The plane was there all arriving passengers had been off for at least 30 minutes prior to our boarding. Moral of the story - my wife said ""I don't care how much more it is to fly Southwest we're never flying US Airways again.""",,,Economy,,,3,1,0,0,,,4,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,T Porfirio,United States,3/19/2015,"I am extremely dissatisfied in US Airways customer service. Our flight to CLT from BOS was delayed due to not having a flight crew and CLT was not allowing any flights to land so we were assured that our connecting flight to MBJ would be made. When we finally got to CLT the flight attendant informed us that the flights were ""on time"" meaning their original time as we were in the air heading to CLT so we were not able to make our connecting flight. He was not able to give us any information (which is ridiculous) and we were promised that there would be US Airways staff at the gate. Of course this was a lie we had to wait in a 3 hour line told there were no other flights to our all inclusive resort told to get a hotel that the airline did not pay for we were in line for standby only once we got to the airport at 6 am. The kiosk assistant tried to split the 3 female travelers up heading to a foreign country after we had each paid 870$ to fly together and then found there were 3 seats on the next flight which demonstrates her incompetence.

On each and every flight children were put in different rows from parents. We were able to switch with other passengers but with little help from staff. One of my daughters was traveling with an eight year old and a three year old. The children were placed in different rows and seats on a 7 hour flight and told there was ""nothing they could do."" Another daughter of mine had an infant and was twice placed in an exit row being told A) They cannot sit there B) You will have to find someone to switch with. (No fault of their own when they assigned the seats). My daughter was also told on our third flight that they could not gate check the baby's stroller. For what reason? No idea.

We therefore missed our flight to Asheville the US Airways staff at Charlotte were very rude and could not care less. I had to beg to use a phone to call my cousin who was picking us up in Asheville to let her know what had happened. The agents at Charlotte said there were no seats left on any flights leaving for Asheville that day or the next I asked what should I do they said not our problem and shrugged their shoulders.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,B Frankeny,United States,3/9/2015,We recently travelled via US Airways to St. Lucia Virgin Islands. Our return flight home was routed through Charlotte N.C. Here we were scheduled for a 3 hour layover plenty of time to get through Customs and Immigration and re-check our baggage for our final destination. However the plane was one hour late in boarding in St. Lucia. Upon our arrival in Charlotte we were told there was no gate open for parking at the airport so we waited on the tarmac for a half hour or so. Then we were told there was no ground crew further delaying our de-planing. Once at the gate we were told that Customs was backed up and we were made to wait for another half hour on the plane. At this point we had 1 hour left to get through Customs and Immigration re-check our baggage and run to our gate actually only 45 minutes as the plane cannot be boarded for the last 15 minutes before take- off. My husband had TSA pre-check on his ticket however I did not. I had to go through a very long security line. My husband went to the gate to notify our plane that I was on my way - hurrying. Just as I finally ran to the gate (just at the 15 minute before flight mark) the flight attendants closed the door to the gate and would not allow me to board. I begged as there was still 15 minutes until take off they would not budge. We went to the ticket counter and were told that it was the last flight out and that there were no flights available the next day. So with no way to get home we rented a car drove all night and arrived back home 8 hours later without our baggage. We were met with rudeness and a complete lack of sympathy from customer service when dealing with the airline. By the way our flight from St. Lucia was to have meals available for purchase however by the time the attendants reach our seat in the 19th row there was no food left. We had not eaten all day.,,,Economy,,2,1,2,1,1,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,D Willows,United States,3/9/2015,Seattle to Phoenix round trip. I was nervous about flying with US/American Airways after checking on this site there were so many poor reviews. When I got on the flights which weren't late or delayed by mechanical problems it was just like most other US domestic airlines I've flown on. The planes might have been a little old but they looked to be in about the same condition as a lot of other commercial carriers. Seats didn't seem to be any less comfortable leg room was average. Probably the biggest downside was that there was no inflight entertainment but they were only 2.5 hour flights so reading a book or playing a game was fine. The crews were nice not overly friendly and the pilots gave a few updates during the flight (both ways) which I always appreciate. I did notice that they didn't mention which baggage claim to go to at the end of either flight which would not be convenient for people that don't just do carry-ons. I'd say overall it's pretty comparable to most other airlines.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,4,1,,,4,1
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Brandt Kertz,United States,3/4/2015,My experience was horrible. My flight coming home to PHL was canceled due to not enough crew members (as the email says). So then they tell me to do stand by for a few flights in Denver which I do. I was at the airport at 7am on a Sunday. All of the stand by fell through so they booked me a flight for 4.05pm to Charlotte n/c and then on to another plane to go to MDT Harrisburg. Everyone boards the plane at 4.20 and we just sit there didn't even move away from the door. Pilot comes over the loud speaker and says they are waiting for paperwork and that their computer system is down. The flight finally left at 6.35pm and arrived in Charlotte at 11.15. The flight ran out of food and only had chips left and when landed everything was closed in the airport so no dinner for me! Missed the connecting flight by almost an hour. So finally at 2am Monday morning I have a flight booked for 9.55am to go to a different airport because they couldn't get me to the other one until Tuesday! I wanted to change airlines but they said I could not get my checked bag back from them which was checked in Denver and at that time I made sure to get my bag switched to the new flight and they gave me a paper saying it was. They ran out of hotel rooms to give out and they said I can either pay for it myself of sleep at the airport. So I stayed at the airport. When I finally landed in Newark NJ my snowboard was not there and is at a different airport which I now have to wait to be shipped to me. If you want to not make any of your flights and waste a bunch of your time and money then I suggest using US Airways.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Susan Mika,United States,3/4/2015,"I was very much surprised and disappointed on my recent flight from Paris France to Philadelphia. I have never seen stewardesses act the way they did on this flight. I am an American yet most of the passengers were European. First off there was a language barrier. Some of the French passengers were sitting in the wrong seats. The stewardesses were telling the passenger to move. When they seemed confused these airline employees started to become very rude telling the passengers that because of them the flight was going to be late. I have never witnessed such disrespect on the employees part I decided to just remain in my seat and do as told not wanting to experience their wrath. No such luck My husband and I were dozing when they passed out ice cream. I couldn't find a spoon with the container. Not wanting to ""bother"" the stewardess I started to eat the ice cream using the lid as a spoon. The stewardess passed by and took the ice cream from my hands and took out the plastic spoon that was contained in the lid. I jokingly said ""sorry I couldn't find it"". Her abrupt response was ""you should have-they made an announcement where to find the spoon five minutes ago"" I could not believe my ears. I didn't even bother to tell her that I did not hear the announcement due to the fact that I was sleeping.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Chavin Suzanne,United States,3/4/2015,Avoid at all costs. Monday my flight was canceled and given notice only minutes before I was going to leave. They then booked me on a flight the next day the last flight out of Cancun for the day. We had to purchase another night at our hotel at my own expense. Then I decided to go online and I found an earlier flight so I called the airlines and they put me on the earliest flight out of Cancun. My plane was second to take off on the tarmac when the pilot announced that a warning light was going on and that he needed it to be fixed. He proceeded to pull the airplane off of the active runway to get a hold of maintenance 20 minutes later announced that we had to return to the gate. But another plane was already at our gate so he pulled as close to the gate as possible so a bus was brought to the plane we got off on a bus and went back to the gate. Two hours later we got back on the bus and back on the plane. So now my flight was four hours late and of course I missed my connection in Philadelphia. When we got off the plane in Philadelphia they were very nice and they already booked my connection on a later flight to Milwaukee. Flight was supposed to leave at 8.30 but of course it did not leave at 8.30 because they did not have a crew for that particular flight. We finally took off at 11.10pm that night. No apologies from anyone all the crew said was we've had a long day too we were delayed for three hours so all of us are tired. Not what I really want to hear when I'm getting onto a flight.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,David Visser,United States,3/4/2015,"US Air has become a disaster zone. First they switched our aircraft and seat assignments without any notification giving us poorer locations. Then no online check-in was available in either direction resulting in chaos at the terminals. The self-service kiosks for one airline wouldn't accommodate the other. (American doesn't recognize US Air confirmation codes and vice versa). Our outbound flight was delayed by an hour to load late cargo. (Why should cargo be given priority? The plane wouldn't have waited if we'd been stuck in a traffic jam or overslept). Onboard the premium economy seats were hardly bigger than standard seats. The earphones at $5 were defective and the jacks in the seats had poor connections. Food options were a joke and the new credit card system does not provide a receipt. Customers were told to go online if they wanted one. Really? All the same check-in problems occurred on the return flight. Then we had to move to a different gate because the plane was (guess what?) delayed. Cargo perhaps. No restrooms on the same level as this new gate and no other services. Then all the same problems with inflight food and entertainment. On landing the crew forgot to ask passengers to fasten seat belts put tray tables/seats in their full and upright position etc. No one came through the aisles checking. And at no time during the flight did the captain or ""flight deck"" welcome passengers or comment on anything. We suspect this is all the result of unhappy people working in an unhappy environment.

No explanation given but I am 100% sure weather had nothing to do with it as all was clear in Charlotte and Greensboro. The remaining three flights that evening were all overbooked. This is what happened before and I ended up waiting around trying to get on a flight all night only to be shuttled to a hotel to spend the night and hopefully get a flight the next morning.

I regretted buying my ticket after I started reading reviews about US Airways. And I was expecting the worst when I flew a couple of days ago. To my surprise it was actually really good. Both flights were early both planes had clearly been updated and were clean and comfortable. The flight attendants were attentive friendly and helpful. On the first flight which left PDX at 5.20 am the FA was careful to not wake people up while also serving those who were awake. When people woke up later and asked for things the FA served them breakfast and drinks with a smile. Breakfast was great - steel cut oats with fresh fruit dried fruit nuts (I don't like eating a huge eggy breakfast early (which was also offered) in the morning and appreciated this healthy choice). The two things that were disappointing about the trip was t he lack of space in first class on the 319 and the lack of entertainment system on a longer flight (4 hours). With regard to the seat when the person in front of me reclined I couldn't use my table and the seat was less than a foot from my face.

Therefore whenever I travel I almost only fly Delta or US Airways. Most recently I flew from CLT to CUN. Although the 757-200 had winglets and the fancy new AA paint job that could not make up for the dissatisfaction I experienced during flight. My seat was very uncomfortable and the cabin was very very dated. There was NO in flight entertainment (not even from the clunky overhead screen). The staff were decent but nothing spectacular. On the way back I flew on an A321 but it felt similar to the 757 I had flown on to CUN. I have flown on every type of plane in the fleet and every plane has this sort of feeling with the exception of the A330 (note: the A330 fleet still feels average when compared to other airlines but is better than every other plane in their fleet. The 767-200s in their fleet are horrible and the A320 family in their fleet is relatively shabby. Regional jets are what you would expect from a regional jet.

Second leg (PHI to MAN UK) we all get on the plane after slight delay and the pilot comes on and says ""We have to replace to doors on the front undercarriage - we'll be here about 15 minutes"". For the next hour we hear every 15 minutes that we will be on the ground for another 15 minutes. Finally we head for the de-icing stand. The pilot tells us that the plane had been standing at the airport all day and it would take extra time to de-ice. If the plane had been there all day why hadn't they taken care of the maintenance and got the plan de-iced before the scheduled departure time? Rest of flight is routine until we get to Manchester when they can't seem to get the jetway to roll up to the door. Come on people how hard can it be? So we have to wait for them to find some steps and we deplane onto the tarmac. Glad it wasn't bucketing with rain. On way back they book us onto a cancelled flight and don't tell us our connection is cancelled until we get to Philadelphia. What's more they think everything is cancelled for Tuesday too and they don't care! Customer service reps weren't even apologetic and certainly weren't interested in helping us get home. So we run over to the departures board and find jetBlue still has flights and we manage to get on a jetBlue flight. Re: Food. They served dinner at 11 O'clock at night - really? All you want them to do at that time is turn the lights down so you can try to sleep.

We rechecked out bags but they didn't ask us for any additional information just took our bags and said we were fine.

I phoned US Airways customer care and thought that they would understand the following - 1) We purchased Direct First Class seats which are more expensive then multiple stop shuttle flights as well as foregoing the lunch even that should have been offered. 2) Cancellations were not due to weather rather maintenance (on two planes)- we lost a day of an already short trip to see family. I requested a change in the RT flights home by 1 day (same flight # etc) to allow our family to make up the time lost. I was told and I quote ""We got you there and that is all we commit to. Given you are requesting a flight change of your choice and not due to the airline there is nothing we can do for you."" The total cost to make the change is $600.00 per person. I was disgusted at the lack of care regarding the situation and further their lack of concern. I would not recommend travelling on this airline.",,,First Class,,,3,1,1,1,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,J Byers,United States,1/11/2015,I have flown with US airways 3 times now and each time has been unpleasant. I wonder if this airline is ever on time. All flights were delayed - once for 12 hours. This time I flew to Puerto Vallarta from San Francisco. The flight to SF was delayed and I had to run with my carry on and barely made my connecting flight. On the way back the check-in service at Puerto Vallarta airport was appalling. I first was directed to a long line to get my boarding pass from a computer and then I had to wait in another line for the US airways staff to look at my visa. Had to board a bus to get to the waiting plane. I booked my ticket / seats well in advance and was not given the seats I had selected - I was seated in the middle over the wing on all flights - the one seat I did not want. When I complained I was told it was my fault for checking in late - I was early and had chosen my seat when I purchased the tickets. I was also told that I did not have the right status to guarantee my seat. On the flight from Phoenix to San Francisco also delayed it was difficult to even get a cup of water. All together a horrible experience. I will be paying the extra dollars for the non-stop service with Alaska Airlines next time.,,,Economy,,,4,3,1,1,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Jennifer Quinn,United States,1/11/2015,I just returned from a family trip to Puerto Vallarta where we all flew US Air! This is the worst airline experience I have experienced. The employees seem to all be rude and unprofessional. It's a real shame since it flies to many destinations I fly to but I will pay more to have an airline that actually values its customers. Every leg of each of our flights were delayed one of our parties missed their flight even though the plane was still at the gate. It set on at the gate for 10 minutes before it pushed away. There were 21 people that needed to be rebooked standing! Same thing happened on the way back! Southwest and Alaska never treats passengers with such disregard.,,,Economy,,,4,1,0,0,,,1,0

Pre- printed boarding so just straight to security. Airside boarding was crowded and pretty disorganized. Flight uneventful but crowded. Lots of families with excited kids but to be expected.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,J Row,United States,12/22/2014,I am disabled and have a great deal of difficulty walking unassisted - cannot bend my knees very far. I flew US Air not realizing how terrible they are. They waited until everyone was boarded before wheeling me to the plane. Since I have difficulty walking all eyes were on me as I very slowly walked to my seat holding onto the headrests of each seat. I had to make one connection with each flight in Charlotte NC. The reservation associate was able to place me on an aisle all but one way and told me when I got to Charlotte that staff at the gate would change me with another passenger. After everyone else had boarded a very rude gate attendant told me the plane was fully booked and they couldn't change my seat which was half way back in the middle seat. A sweet young lady on the aisle offered to change with me so at least I was able to accomplish that. I cannot carry any weight other than a handbag I asked the male flight attendant to carry my carryon to my seat and place it in the overhead for me he begrudging did it turned around in a huff and walked away afterwards. Staff were all rude. I will never fly this airline again. No food was offered on a flight that was almost 2 hours long. I also experienced a delay almost missing my connecting flight.,,,Economy,,,3,1,1,0,,,1,0

us-airways,US Airways customer review,D Brooke,United States,12/18/2014,US799 AMS to PHL. Take this flight often unfortunately due to no other direct flights between these 2 locations. Firstly ground staff at PHL check in are just unfriendly. Surly and not one smile. The aircraft's they use on this leg often breaks down and the interior is extremely outdated. You get to watch a movie on an overhead screen zero selection. It's like flying on something from 20 years ago. What could make up for this is the cabin crew but unfortunately they too are surly and clearly lost all sense of customer service after many years on the job.,,,Economy,,,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,M Phil,United States,12/10/2014,Flight 730 CLT-LHR economy. Boarded surprisingly early. Not full flight. Almost 1 hr delay at the gate after boarding due to mechanical issue but strong tail winds made up for most of it. Water was offered during the delay. Dinner was choice of chicken with risotto or pasta with Alfredo sauce plus soft cheese and crackers roll and butter garden salad and dressing and a dessert bar. The entrée is just the same as a microwave meal so if you like that you will like the food onboard. If you don't you won't. I did. Was pleasantly surprised by two changes since my last trip on this flight less than a month earlier - beer is now complimentary in economy. Previously only the house red / white wine was complimentary. Also the pre-arrival snack is more extensive. Before it was a hot muffin. Now it's the same hot muffin with a couple other bagged treats. CLT is nice for frequent flyers. Security Checkpoint C is kept for the elite levels so not much wait there. Also the preferred access lets you bypass the line of people waiting to board and go right to the front and be the next one on the plane.,,,Economy,,9,3,4,4,4,,,3,1

us-airways,US Airways customer review,B Walters,Canada,12/10/2014,I flew from Fort Lauderdale to Philadelphia and on to Ottawa on 24 Nov. I cannot say that this was a good travel experience. My first impression on arrival at the Fort Lauderdale check-in in counter was a dismal fail. Even though there were hardly any people in line I was ignored standing first in the wrong line then once directed to another line was ignored by the agent there until finally another approached and proceeded to get my baggage tag. The flights themselves were fairly uneventful and the inflight staff were much more friendly. The seating was however not comfortable nor was there any kind of seatback entertainment system like on other airlines. The flight from Philadelphia to Ottawa was a quick regional jet flight and therefore I am used to no on board amenities. This flight was not horrible but the poor reception at Fort Lauderdale did leave me feeling like I might not choose US Airways for my next transborder flight.,,,Economy,,5,2,3,1,1,,,3,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,J Beyer,United States,12/10/2014,I was using a duffle sized soft bag as my carry on and the US Airways check-in assistant told me it was too big and I had to check it. I told her I had flown the previous day with US Airways and many other times using this same bag and it had never been a problem. Extremely dismissive - looked at my ticket and told me that I wasn't a preferred member. We put the bag on the frame and it fit. Told that it didn't matter and I had to check the bag. I checked the measurements of the bag online and it is compliant with airline requirements for carry on luggage. I am furious that status with an airline and one person's opinion impacts my service.

The US Airways staff offered to put large carry-ons in the hold for free. The flight was uneventful staff indifferent. Connection in PHL well done. Terminal A looks amazing. Terminals B-E were very small and crowded. The flight from PHL to PUJ I was amazed that US Airways decided to use a twin-aisle A330. The crew was funny cheerful and helpful. The seats were reasonably clean and well spaced seatback IFE with quite the selection of games and videos/songs.

I am disabled and my husband checked the night before to make sure a wheelchair would be ready at the airport. Seattle to Tucson via Phoenix. No wheelchair in Seattle finally after waiting at check-in for 45 minutes the desk clerk was worried I was going to miss the flight and grabbed a wheel chair and I was put on plane at the last minute. Arrived at Phoenix - no wheelchair - person working at desk ignored me. Another passenger interrupted her and told her I needed assistance and I finally got help. Arrived in Tucson - no wheelchair - had to walk from tarmac to baggage. Wheelchair available for another customer - asked the person if he could get one for me he shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Customer service a nightmare - do not want to talk to you in person.

Flight to DCA on an E190 and it barely half full which provided a very comfortable flight and legroom and recline were good. No beverage runs this time due to heavy turbulence. Made it to my flight to SYR with a minute to spare this flight on a smaller E170. The flight attendant serving my row was an absolute delight. Per usual like all other major US carriers they lack the polish and finesse of their Asian counterparts. However she was very friendly warm and she made a lot of interaction with me and other passengers. I was given a whole can of Coke which is always nice flight was seamless and arrived on time.

After sitting in the airport from 7:00am until 3:30pm our 8:30am flight was finally canceled. We repeatedly stood in line to find out what was going only to be told our best bet was to wait for that plane to be repaired. A part was coming at 11:00am and then it was coming at 2:00pm. By the time they received the part and found out it didn't correct the problem it was too late and there were no more flights that day. We were kept in the dark all day unless we went to find out what was going on. When the flight was officially canceled no one even announced it.

(no announcement). 15 minutes later they said it would be another 15 minutes. Some time passed and they said they couldn't fix the plane in time so they were going to give us another one. Then they said we were waiting for a storm to pass before they brought the plane from the hanger. They finally got a plane over to the terminal then started trying to find the flight crew who had apparently left the airport. Crew later said they were told the flight was cancelled (although they never told the passengers that). They found the crew boarded zone 1 and 2 then realized the captain was missing so they asked everyone to deboard the plane. A Captain was eventually found. Plane took off 3.5 hours after scheduled time. We wouldn't have known anything that was happening if we hadn't been sitting near the gate desk. Communication was terrible to the passengers.

Repeatedly shuttled from one terminal to another while the monitors were either not updated or working at all. We were told to go to customer service. Line was 150 yards long as I paced it. After an hour the same couple was at the counter. Two girls behind the counter. Finally took to the phone for help.

Nobody cared whether passengers had to drink or to eat the shops in Charlotte were closed. Our flight US1917 five days earlier from Philadelphia was delayed for two hours. The plane had to return to the gate due to maintenance. The airline always prevented online booking with free luggage although it was already booked. US airlines are not committed to pay penalty.

Instead of landing we circled Phoenix airport for over an hour then were diverted to New Mexico. After sitting on the tarmac for over 4 hours at Albuquerque airport we were told that the flight had to be canceled. Upon exiting the plane we were told to contact customer service (800 number). We were told that no reimbursements for hotels would be made and that there were no flights available that we could get on until the following Monday. I was told to ask about flight 9011 the next day which flew to Phoenix. The agent said she could put me on that flight but any flights continuing to San Jose the same day were not available. Later that evening I found a flight out of Phoenix to San Jose on Priceline for $337.00 and booked it so I could get home. Guess which airline that was on? US Airways! US Airways had one agent at the ticketing counter the following morning and over 187 people in line. Two days later I pulled up my unused ticket to request a refund and it shows a connecting ticket which I was not told about nor did I use and I am outraged!

It left on time and arrived to LAX few minutes early. Flight was smooth but trying to sleep and relax in those coach seats was uncomfortable.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,C Maher,United States,9/17/2014,"On our last US Airways trip the return from Athens was a complete disaster. I verified my seats and flights twice in the week before I left home. I brought a printed copy of the itinerary from their website. At the airport I was told that ""you don't have seats on the first leg of your journey from Athens to Zurich (Swiss Air). I see your reservation but for some reason US Airways cancelled your seats on that portion of the trip. The flight is full you don't have seats call them. Step aside."" I did call US Airways - on hold for long stretches while their personnel verified that it was the next day in Athens vs. where the customer service is located in the U.S. and while they tried to put me on a flight now leaving in 1/2 hour. We ran to the Lufthansa check-in as instructed - after repeated attempts to get tickets we were told by Lufthansa that they could see the reservation but US Airways hadn't completed the task and we couldn't get on board. I called US Airways again in front of the Lufthansa check-in (more time on hold despite explaining that we had less than 1/2 hour to get tickets clear security and get to the gate). They verified that the last agent had not completed our reservation in Lufthansa's system. They now instructed us to go to Swiss Air and get the same tickets since they were codeshare partners on the Lufthansa flight. While explaining that Swiss Air was where we started and on the other side of the airport the announcement closing that flight was made. US Airways then stated they could do nothing until the next day's flight to get us out. I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor reiterated that nothing from Athens was available until the next day. I told her that I could see online that several flights were available to European gateway cities that morning but was told that US Airways couldn't put me on those flights. She was more helpful when I offered to get us to any European gateway on my dime but then told me that all the flights from London Paris Rome Amsterdam Munich etc. were full. My wife tried again and did reach someone that routed us to Paris and home on Air France. Air France was a welcome change and they actually worked to correct more US Airways problems created during re-booking us.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Ben Weeks,United States,9/17/2014,I fly with US Airways a lot and they are average nothing special. Flying from CLT-SAN we usually leave on time a few minutes early even. But ever since they removed inflight entertainment on their domestic flights a 5 hour flight on an A320 is a little long. Make sure to bring your own things for movies and music Airbus A320 was older with some signs of age and grime on it taffy stuffed into what used to be a power port on my armrest 2 skittles stuck to the carpet under my seat leather was worn as well. Cabin Crew were nice and attentive drinks and snacks were average though their marketplace meals are not as quality. Just a few days before our trip US Airways changed our flight numbers and if I had not looked at the reservation again I might have been in a little trouble in finding the gate. If you don't like spending a lot of money try not to bring huge suitcases that need to be checked as US Airways charges 25 extra dollars per bag each way. US Airways is an average airline nothing very special.,,,Economy,,7,4,5,3,1,,,4,1
us-airways,US Airways customer review,J McTaggart,United States,9/14/2014,"I booked my trip through Orbitz. The trip was ""must be there on time"" type of trip. I was very pleased that check in was made easy to do online I had no problems with baggage as I carried only 1 bag with me. We traveled from DFW to Charlotte NC then onto Charleston WV. The plan for the first leg of the trip was excellent my only critique would be on that 2nd leg of the trip which was in a much smaller plane and the seats were pretty ""snug"". However we were on time the entire way there. On the way back our trip was delayed from leaving almost 2 hrs but there had been storms that had come through which had thrown many other flights off and I guess that was natures fault. All the staff was very friendly. They served only a beverage as our trips were short and I didn't mind.

We had the exact experience with a cancelled flight from YEG to PHX as a previous post David had because of crew members not showing up. This was a 6.20am flight and was cancelled while we were in line to board. US Airways were extremely rude in re-routing us it was a take it or leave it proposal. And my experience continues to be horrible as I continue to deal with their customer service. Do not use this airline!,,,Economy,,,3,1,1,1,,,1,0

Although entire plane was loaded we waited 45 minutes for the same two pilots to show up for this second aircraft. This plane finally pulled out of the gate about 7.20pm and after a short taxi back into another gate to check an allegation of a supposed ""bulging window seal"" on an A320 which a passenger claimed to have seen. You cannot see window seals from the interior of the aircraft. This supposed mechanical problem for which no repair measures were taken prevented us from leaving Phoenix until 9pm Pacific.

The woman at the desk was rude and uncooperative saying that the policy says 45 minutes and I was late. I found another agent and she said all that she could do was put me on another flight leaving 10 minutes later but it was not a non stop and I would get to sea title 5 hours later than the first flight. The policy I found online at their web site states you must be at the airport 30 minutes before your flight departs to check a bag.

I was told by the staff that we should ask the people who were in the seats next to some of us if they would move to let our family stay together. Got to Philly and heard a blurb over the tannoy so I went to the desk and asked about it and was abruptly told to wait. Asked again about sitting together only to be told the same thing again at least that's standardisation for you.

The flight attendants appeared stressed and not really emitting a feeling that they were glad to have the customers aboard. The food was two meatballs and one broccoli spear. I know economy class should not whine but the meal looked so pitiful. The movie for my cross Atlantic flight (going and returning 2 weeks later was the ""Muppet Movie"").

About 6.5 hours after its scheduled departure time (including over 5 hours of being forced to stay on the plane) US Airways cancelled its flight and left us all to find another flight. By the time all the mechanical issues were finally resolved there was bad weather in Orlando so conveniently the US Airways records state that the flight was cancelled due to weather issues. If the flight had left on time there would be no weather issues.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,G Jordan,United Kingdom,8/18/2014,Return flights from Manchester (UK) - Charlotte (USA) - Las Vegas (USA). Very disappointed with these flights. OK with the domestic flight you don't expect much. A seat which was comfy enough and one or two drinks runs. Bog standard plane no inflight entertainment and had to pay for wifi. Fine for the four hour domestic flight. Transatlantic though different matter. On a Boeing 757. Same comfy seats (all seats were in the extra legroom section but the actual seats were the same in normal economy). Very dated entertainment as in TVs down the centre isle therefore no choice what to watch or when. No wifi on the planes either. Even if it was the same wifi as on the domestic flight it didn't give the chance to use streaming services such as netflix etc. The result? A very boring 10 hours on a plane. Food was OK nothing special or bad apart from the kids meal. We reserved one for our 5 year old in case the normal meal was a bit too adult for a kids palate. As it turned out the normal meal would have been fine for ours. But the kids meal consisted of chicken nuggets or similar potato croquettes and sweetcorn followed by biscuits and grapes. Breakfast was a bagel with butter and jam. We had a lovely blueberry muffin. A bit of common sense would have been to keep the puddings and breakfasts the same throughout just change the main meal to suit. Drinks runs were at the start and the end of the flight only.

There was a second attendant who was looking at everyone's carry-on bags. When my wife passed the boarding pass scanner she rudely told my wife she couldn't board because she had three carry-on items - a purse a book bag and an envelope. She made my wife put the envelope into the book bag. I have no clue what made this US Air employee so spectacularly unable to deal with the public on this day but it left a bad taste in my mouth.

On board service is ok but would not pay for business class again. It is overpriced for the slightly larger seat. Food is ok. The real problem came when we arrived at 22.00 at LAX. We were off loaded and waited by the baggage claim. Luggage did not arrive until about 30-40 mins later. That would not be a big problem. The problem came when about 10 of us did not receive our luggage. The luggage belt kept going but after about an hour it became obvious nothing else was going to come. I headed over to the luggage office and to my surprise the luggage was lined up to the other side by the entrance to the airport - you could have literally walked from outside make two steps take my luggage and leave and no one not even cameras would see you come in. I approached the staff and raised my concern plus why did my suitcase not come the normal way. She proceeded to tell me it came on earlier flight. After asking why would they not inform us via PA system - she advised me there was no PA system they could use.

Outbound flight was ok on airbus A330 but food was terrible. The real fun began on the return flight. Having checked in (self service next to the desk) we discovered that although I had booked 3 seats together US Airways had decided to seat me away from my wife and young daughter). When I asked the attendant if he could change my seat to where I booked next to my family he replied ""oh but yours is a nice seat"". I replied ""ok but I want to sit with my family as I had booked so can you please arrange it"" to which he replied ""oh but yours is a nice seat"". Eventually he said ""sorry I cannot do anything you will have to ask them in Charlotte"". Eventually the lady at the gate managed to change my seat for me for the 1st flight but couldn't for the 2nd one and I would have to change it in Charlotte. Luckily the lady at the gate was sympathetic to my request and seated us all together for the Manchester flight. On boarding the flight (a 757 Aircraft) it was a very outdated plane for a transatlantic flight! The TV screens were down the aisles not in the back of the seats and worse still the one at the back where we were seated did not work for the entire flight. Again the food was very poor for the main meal but that was nothing compared to breakfast! This consisted of a single warm small muffin/cake and a cup of coffee or tea. When I asked where the breakfast was they replied ""that's it"". If I had to rate this airline I would give it a 1 out of 10 at the very most.

No updates given and an hour later departure pushed back to 9.00am. Then 10.00am and now announce they will start trying to move people to other flights because still no idea when crew will arrive. Line up for 1/2 hour only to get to front and be told they are only re-accommodating people with connecting flights and since my final destination is PHX I have to wait because the plane will still be going which I know by past experience with US Airways is unlikely. Then departure pushed back to 11 and a while later to 12pm when they finally mark it cancelled. So 2 hours in line now to get re-accommodated. By this time all other options for the day are full best they can do is 2 days later! Rebook on another airline for next day. Never given explanation nor apology they seem to delay cancellations as long as possible so people find other flights on their own and then don't need to give any compensation because flight not cancelled.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,M Domingue,United Kingdom,8/7/2014,Our opinion of US Airways is that their customer service is poor and their organisation falls apart when planes are cancelled. On our flight out US 722 from Dublin to Philadelphia the attitude of the US Airways Dublin check- in staff was somewhat aloof. The flight attendants were grumpy and did not appear to want to be doing their jobs. Our return flight from Philadelphia to Dublin went well until the captain ineptly described that they had a fault with the GPS and navigation systems in that they did not agree. However he described we would be OK as we were still over land and this would aid them to guide the plane back to Philadelphia. After 3 hours we were diverted to Philadelphia where we found that US Airways lacked in all areas of how to deal with this event. On landing the cabin crew simply said proceed to baggage terminal C where you will be accommodated. On arrival in Terminal C no clear instructions were given as to why to do next and there was no US Airways staff present who could organise the skeleton staff to help with everyone finding alternative flights. One staff member wandered around with a business card saying that you could go to the ticket desk or ring a number to make arrangements for other flights. However not everyone got this card and we had to help some families who were not made aware of this. After 3 hours of telephone calls and waiting in a queue US Airways did find us alternative flights and accommodation which was positive. However the staff guiding us in the queues were extremely rude and the US Airways staff member aiding families in the taxi rank to get taxis was completely out of her depth in this job. At one point there were about 30 of us queuing with a line a taxis waiting and a major argument between taxi drivers and staff. I honestly thought a few of the female passengers were going to break down in tears. Essentially our disappointment is not with the mechanical failure of the plane but in the very poor attitude of the US Airway staff and extremely poor leadership and organisation as soon we were left to our devices once the plane was returned to Philadelphia airport.,,,Economy,,,3,1,3,4,,,1,0

Had to wait in a long line to be put on a new flight. Cabin crew from other flights dame and pushed in at the top of the line making our wait even longer! Could not believe how rude they were. Even though Philadelphia is a hub for them and the flight was fully booked they could not find an alternative aircraft. And lots seemed to be sitting around going nowhere. We took a flight to Boston. Very rude woman at the gate looked at my BA Silver card and yelled - You are not preferred customers! She did not even know who US Airways partner airlines are. We arrived in Boston on a plane with broken toilets. None working in Economy. There is always something broken on a US Airways plane. Our bags were sent to Bagnor.

Our flight (#1836) was cancelled due to ""crew unavailable"" and not due to weather. The ""crew unavailable"" referred only to the pilot. The flight attendants for this flight were all there ready at the door waiting to board. Before the flight was cancelled the announcement stated that we were ""just waiting for the pilot"". US air claimed that this could be due to a domino effect of an inbound flight not arriving on time. I would agree with them that it would be difficult to find a whole flight crews but in this case we were only waiting for the pilot. This situation was not due to an unforeseen circumstance yet they blame the weather for their mismanagement. They should have a stand by pilot for this situation. I consider myself a seasoned traveler and this is not my first time encountering flight delay or cancellation. Other airlines had not only provided me with an overnight stay at a nearby hotel but also had a bus ready to shuttle all the passenger to the hotel and provided us with an overnight kit.

Inflight entertainment system also allowed you to see your trip progress though you had to push a little hard to select things. If that's your only complaint it's a good entertainment system.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,D Prager,United States,8/7/2014,"I flew from Las Vegas to Salisbury (Maryland). It was supposed to be a quick weekend trip. All I had was a small carry on and personal bag. They ran out of over head room and I had to check my suitcase in. I figured I would get it back once I reached Philly for my layover. They actually checked it in. Did not bother to tell anyone this. To make matters worse my connecting flight was delayed. Overall flight going was bearable despite the inconveniences. Returning however a whole other story. I arrived at the tiny airport an hour before the security check point was open. After getting through security with the 30 other passengers we waited about 20 minutes extra. We all board in an efficient manner. About 1/2 of us had to check in our small pieces of luggage because the plane was too small for it to be true carry on. So we board and are ready to take off. The pilot arrived we waited 15 minutes before taking off. I have 64 minutes of a layover. We get near philly and have to circle around then land. After landing we sit on the tarmac for 5 minutes in 2 different spots. I have less than 15 minutes to get to my gate. We deplane and wait for the ground crew to unload the ""carry on"" luggage. They move with no purpose. Most of the fight has less than 20 minutes to catch their next flight. I get my bag. No fault to the airline but my connecting flight is out of a different gate and I have to take a shuttle there. This trip takes about 7 minutes. I see my plane at the gate. By the time I got to the gate the plane was pulling away. After all of this the next day my flight took off about 45 minutes behind schedule. I had a horrible experience all around nor did the airline seem to b remorseful for the 12 hour inconvenience.",,,Economy,,,3,1,1,1,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,G Smith,United Kingdom,8/7/2014,US0785 and US2888. 28th July 2014. Edinburgh to Philadelphia / Philadelphia to Cleveland. What a terrible airline. The staff are ignorant and unfriendly the aeroplanes are old and dated looking. I used this airline via 4 separate flights within 1 week and I will never do it again! Even the US Airways ground staff were ignorant and unhelpful. I missed my connecting flight due to standing at Customs (Philly) for 2 hrs and the plane was still at the gate when I finally arrived. However they then told us that the flight was oversold anyway! Then shoved onto standby for the next 2 flights only to be told that they were full and to come back the next morning. The staff were hopeless! I had to pay for my own hotel room and not even so much as a sorry!,,,Economy,,,1,1,2,1,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Pothos George,Greece,8/7/2014,The plane bound from Athens Greece to Philadelphia Pennsylvania broke down and we waited in the plane for an hour and a half. In Philadelphia I went through customs like clock work. I dropped my baggage off for my connecting flight to Chicago and here is where the problems started. My baggage got on another flight and not with mine. At Chicago I rushed to get the baggage so I could catch the next coach to my final destination of South Bend IN regional airport where I was to pick up a rental car. This was not the case. Ground staff of US Airways gave me the run around for two hours plus. Finally consulting with the ground security I asked kindly if the staff could check their computer and locate my baggage. The ground staff told me my baggage would arrive after 9pm by which time I would have lost the last coach to Indiana. I told them to forward my baggage to my motel the next day. My baggage came after three days and a long struggle.,,,Economy,,1,3,1,3,5,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,S Chapman,Mexico,8/3/2014,US Airways 502 and 1836 on July 21st 2014. Having read the reviews on this site I became quite nervous about flying with US Airways! What were they going to do to me? To my luggage? What lies would they make up? So happy to say I had a completely non-eventful perfectly normal flight with pleasant flight attendants punctual timing useful information and all my baggage arriving on time and in good condition. Better legroom than some airlines I've been on. Helpful friendly people all through. Twice we were served beverages - no food so that might be my only gripe but it's a small one really. I think it's important to write a review even when things go well to counteract all the bad ones on here. Flight from Mexico City to Las Vegas via Phoenix.,,,Economy,,9,4,5,3,0,,,4,1

Gate agents and flight crew provided conflicting information to passengers causing unnecessary confusion on multiple accounts and required zone 5 boarding passengers to gate check carry-on bags containing electronics when ample overhead bin space was indeed available.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Ronilla Ernest,United States,7/31/2014,IAH to BWI - 7/26/14. I was forced to check-in my small carry-on bag at the gate. I am allowed to carry a personal item and a small carry-on bag and I had packed accordingly. I had my important financial documents and laptop in my carry-on. The agents at the gate were very rude and inflexible and I was forced to take out my laptop and the binder full of financial documents and carry them on the plane and they checked-in my almost empty suitcase! To make matters worse I got on the plane and discovered that the overhead bins all around my seat were empty. I have been flying for a long time and this has never happened with any other airline. I did not appreciate being forced into a situation with no options and being told by the agent at the gate to look for another flight if I did not check-in my bag. The staff need training in customer service. If my ticket states I am allowed to carry a small carry-on bag into the plane and there is room on the plane then there is no reason to be forced to check my bag. Incidentally this is the second time I had a bad experience with US Airways. A few years ago another rude gate agent yelled at me for carrying a bag for my husband who was on crutches! The agent insisted that my husband had to carry his own bag even though he is on crutches. Needless to say I will not be flying US Airways again.,,,Economy,,1,3,3,2,0,,,3,0

us-airways,US Airways customer review,A Ciotti,United States,7/29/2014,"My family and I flew from PHL to Rome Italy. Our 2 year old son has a severe peanut allergy. I called in advance to ask if I could board early to clean his seat and if they could make an announcement regarding the allergy. I do not expect anyone to change their eating habits we just wanted to make those immediately around us aware. I was told on the phone it is up to the individual crew the day of our flight. When we boarded the plane I asked a member of the crew. She said she would check. As I was seated a flight attendant came up to me and said in a condescending tone ""It is our policy that we do not make any exceptions for those with food allergies. We cannot guarantee anything and we do not make announcements. We do not serve peanuts but other people can eat what they want."" We just informed the people directly around us and they were more than understanding. The staff were just rude in general. My mother-in-law got up to get something that fell on the floor for my daughter. The flight attendant barked at her to move. She said ""Move we are coming through with the cart."" Where is common courtesy? When they came around with the beverage cart they merely said ""Drink""? At first we gave the airline the benefit of the doubt thinking it was only this crew. On our return to PHL the crew was worse. We didn't ask them to make an announcement as we knew the response would be the same. We did however inform the flight attendant of our son's allergy. During the flight I came out of the bathroom to notice that a woman was dipping her pretzels in peanut butter. I calmly asked the flight attendant if I could move away because of the peanut butter. She looked at me and said ""What do you want me to do""? I said ""I cannot stand here with him for long."" She scoffed and said facetiously to her partner "" We need to move because this kid has an allergy."" I should also note that the company said it does not serve peanuts or peanut products on the plane: however the pretzels handed to everyone were from ""King Nuts."" The package clearly stated that it may contain traces of peanuts and tree nuts. Clearly US Airways does not recognize the severity of the allergy.",,,Economy,,,2,1,1,3,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,D Sorensen,United States,7/27/2014,June 21-22 2014 HNL-TPA by way of PHX. First Class. First leg fine nice crew comfy seat decent meal. Second leg - not so much! Almost 4 hour flight landing in TPA at 6.30 am - breakfast should have been served but all we got was a teeny bag of not very good pretzels. When questioned about this shabby treatment US customer relations (first time around) said that no meal should have been served. Upon a second communication they said sorry yes - breakfast should have been served. Their solution was to offer a small voucher (which expires in a year) toward a future US flight which is completely useless to me as my travel plans for the coming year are already in place. They feel this represents some kind of value and is acceptable as reparation for the shabby treatment. The seats were uncomfortable they had a built in pillow which prevents you from putting your head back. It is not removable. So if you book first class on US make sure you find out what you're paying for - you may not be getting much. They have lost this customer.,,,First Class,,1,1,4,1,0,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,T Smith,United States,7/27/2014,I purchased a flight with American Airline to fly from Miami to New Orleans on July 3-7. They changed my flight to US Air but didn't inform me until one week before flight. I paid for upgrade seats but it was not transferred over. Now what really bother me was my return trip home from New Orleans well I didn't get back until a day later. Both airlines seemed to simply want to place blame on each other when they should be working together on rescheduling flights when they cancel them. American whom I booked with originally were of absolutely no use to me once they changed me to a US Air flight. Though it took many back and forth trips between the two companies finally a supervisor with US Air provided me with some assistance in getting me booked on another flight to fly out a day later. It's ridiculous that it would take me 4 hours in the airport to get rescheduled when I checked in well in advance (4hours) after my flight was canceled. I should not have needed a supervisor to get my flight rescheduled all agents should be able to do it. I went through 5 agents between AA and US Air and none were helpful. When airlines join forces to become one company they should be operating as one not passing the buck and blame between each other.,,,Economy,,1,3,1,0,0,,,1,0

The flight was canceled the previous day. ""Mechanical issues"". At least we get a night in a hotel w/meals. The next day we get out of Ireland to Philly - board for next connection only to sit on tarmac. Pilot tells us there is bad weather in Charlotte. Once we take off pilot gets on intercom to ask flight crew to stay seated through the flight due to turbulence. In 1st class drinks and food being served throughout the flight no turbulence encountered. This is all suspicious to us as on our flight out of the U.S. we got delayed on the tarmac until the crew timed out thank goodness Delta helped us get us out!

us-airways,US Airways customer review,R Setzer,United States,7/27/2014,"I was taking two US Airways flights on my return trip from a cruise Miami to Charlotte (their hub) and then Charlotte to Dayton Ohio. I waited in Miami airport all afternoon for my evening flight and it wasn't until it was about boarding time that they updated the flight boards to show the plane was delayed. They started calling people up to try to get them on different flights but by that time it was too late for me to get on another good connecting flight. The gate agent couldn't find any other good connections except for the flight from Charlotte to Dayton that wouldn't leave again until the next morning. The Miami to Charlotte flight ended up being 1.5 hrs late due to mechanical issues. We quickly boarded as just about everyone had a connecting flight that night. Staff onboard were rude and terse with everybody. They could have at least given us some empathy and info on where to go inside their hub to get new connecting flights but they didn't. Once we finally landed and everybody got up to leave then they finally announced that all the connecting flights for the evening have already left. I got in line at their customer service desk and heard them repeating the same things like robots: ""no vouchers"" ""due to weather"" ""we can't help you."" Mind you we were told it was mechanical issues in Miami and now they were claiming it was the weather. I was lucky that I managed to get a hotel voucher after the lady next to me pressed the issue but I don't know if anyone else got one and made my way back to the airport in the morning.

We arrived to the airport after confirming that our flight was on time only to find that our flight was delayed 2 hours to Phoenix. It was supposed to be the first leg of our Anniversary trip to Puerto Vallarta Mexico. We finally got on the plane and of course our next flight out of Phoenix left without us. There were no planes to Puerto Vallarta that day. The agent gave us a number to call to get a hotel either for free or for a discount and neither were true. We spent the night in Phoenix when we should have been in Mexico. We upgraded to first class to make up for the disaster and made it to PV just fine. We thought that the return trip couldn't be bad but we pulled away from the terminal and sat on the runway for 30 minutes had to go back to the terminal and wait an additional 1.5 hrs on the plane before take off! The delay was blamed on communication / paperwork issues with the PV airport. No extra drinks. Meanwhile we had a connecting flight out of Phoenix and visions of the same thing happening all over again played in our heads.

Although no meal was offered FA's came around multiple times offering snacks and followed up with me throughout the flight on alcoholic drink refills. I'm not sure if this service is worth paying full price for as it does not come with lounge access and you have to pay for use of in-flight wifi which I think is inappropriate for a first-class experience.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Aaron Agmata,United States,7/13/2014,6/24/14 on a round trip from Honolulu to Denver. I arrived at HNL airport before the recommended 2 hour time prior to take off. Upon my arrival I noticed that the plane was already at the gate. They loaded the first group of passengers and then the gate personnel said that there was a problem with the air conditioning so everyone had to deplane. This plane was at the gate for over 2 hours and no one noticed that the AC was out? We finally take off 1.5 hrs late. We arrived at Phoenix and I had to run to my next connection gate. I barely made my connection flight to Denver but my carry-on which I was told to check at the gate because there was no room on the plane did not make it. My return trip back to Honolulu was even worse. Again I got to the airport 2 hours prior to boarding. A plane was at the gate but the gate agent told me that it wasn't my flight. The gate agent assured me that this would be the gate for boarding. Half hour prior to boarding the gate agent tells everyone that we need to switch gates then we had to wait another half hour for another plane to taxi out of the gate. When my flight finally arrived at the gate it was discovered that one of the rear emergency masks was faulty. Again we have to wait. We are finally allowed to board on the plane a half hour after the scheduled boarding time to wait another two hours to take off. First the pilot says they have to refuel then we couldn't take off because of weather. This caused me to miss my connection flight to Honolulu from Phoenix. While I was waiting to take off I get an email from US Airways that due to the delay and me missing my connection flight I was being moved to another flight connecting from PHX to LAX and then to HNL but the flight wasn't until the next day and no mention of them paying for a place for me to stay.

All three of them got a seat. Then they book me the next day to go to NY and take a Delta Connector. This time customer service does it wrong and I have no reservation on Delta and am now sitting in NY with no place to go. I am now 2 nights and 3 days into my delay.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Tony Halsall,United Kingdom,7/3/2014,Something has happened to US Airways in the last couple of months that has affected the moral and attitude of staff. I make a three leg trip Manchester - Ohio - Florida - Manchester four times a year and have done for the last two or three years without issue until this last flight. 1) Baggage issues with the intermediate leg. US Airways computers do not register that the intermediate leg is part of a international journey and so flag up a checked baggage fee. Normally someone is on hand to over-rule the glitch and apply the correct code but this relies on the staff wanting to be helpful. I was treated outrageously by the so called supervisor in Cleveland last week and rather than argue the point any further i just paid and walked away so as not to cause delays to waiting passengers behind me. 2) The latest return leg to Manchester was the worst display of cabin crew attitude that I have ever experienced. Lying about a row of empty seats and saying they were empty for weight and balance issues when in fact they were subsequently used for the cabin crew to sleep on. Also to be refused a top up of wine with the meal (they were slow delivering the meal) but offering to sell me a $7 bottle instead was just pathetic.

We had not mechanical issues or weather delays but our airplane left 25-30 minutes late from a small airport in Bangor Maine (i.e. not a lot of airport traffic either). I arrived at my connecting flight in Philadelphia to watch the doors close and the plane depart but absolutely no effort was made to have the plane wait an extra 5-10 minutes for the passengers that had just landed.

When I got to the gate it was pushed back to 9.50 pm. Finally after much hesitation I had to call and take myself off the flight and find my luggage. When I looked up that flight later it did not actually leave until 10.45 pm. When I went to go claim my luggage after about 30 minutes of not being able to locate it they discovered it was in Phoenix. It apparently made it on an earlier flight that it was not tagged for. I finally got it back at 8.30 pm the following evening.,,,Economy,,,0,3,0,0,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,K Michaels,United States,6/16/2014,Some friends and I booked flights from Nashville to St. Thomas. From there we were to take a cab to a ferry to Marina Cay. Lo and behold our flight was delayed due to maintenance. This caused us to miss the last ferry out resulting in a hotel stay in St. Thomas. As if that were not bad enough. one week later on our way back to the US we arrived at the St. Thomas airport three hours early for our flight. None of the kiosks worked to check in and there wasn't a single employee working. Luckily we had so much time. The passengers flying out on an earlier flight had experienced much worse panic when they were unable to check in to their flight that was leaving in less than an hour. Once all eight employees arrived at the same exact time we waited in a ridiculous long line of frustrated people. Happy to finally get to our gate we learned that our flight was delayed due to maintenance again!,,,Economy,,1,3,3,3,3,,,1,0

But after a 10 hour flight from Rome to Charlotte we arrive to find out flight to Tallahassee was cancelled. The customer service person was polite but kept getting distracted as she rebooked us on a Delta flight to get us home 4 hours later than originally planned. Our luggage made it the next day. I started researching and find out that cancelled flights are a frequent problem on US Airways. Don't fly them if you want to get where you are going on time!,,,Economy,,3,3,3,4,4,,,3,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Douglas Janes,Canada,6/10/2014,US Airways now stoops to lying. Boarding my flight today I had to sit through the usual nonsense announcements that the flight is fully booked and overhead luggage storage is limited so customers should come up to the podium to check their bags. In the past I have ignored these pleas and I have not had a problem. I never check my baggage if I can help it because the best case is that you waste 30 to 45 minutes at your destination waiting for your bags to come down the carrousel. Worst case the airline loses your baggage or locks it up and leaves for the day because you make the mistake of going to the washroom before going to the carrousel. Today US Airways didn't achieve their quota of checked baggage so they decided to step it up a notch and report that one passenger has already come to the front of the airplane to check his baggage because the overhead storage is completely full so I dutifully went to the podium to check my bag. What do I find when I board the plane? Lots of available overhead storage. I am completely incensed at this behaviour and will not fly US Airways again if I can help it.,,,Economy,,,3,3,3,1,,,3,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Richard Dorn,United States,6/8/2014,We flew Houston-Charlotte-Lisbon (5/24/14). Flight 760 over wasn't too bad food was ok for coach. It was booked for us by Road Scholar as part of our travel package. I didn't have high expectations but it wasn't bad for being economy. The return US 761 (6/2/14) was the trip from hell starting with the oldest 757 I've ever flown. Late leaving Lisbon stupidest security personnel ever encountered. The front economy toilet had been repaired with putty glue you name it didn't work properly. Crew just plain didn't give a flip about passengers or service on board.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,S Brown,United States,6/4/2014,I was very unhappy with my trip - flights delayed both ways and of course the connecting flight couldn't wait. I made a mad dash across the Charlotte airport from Concourse B to E (or was it the other way round?) to try to catch it though there were less than 5 minutes; I guess I hoped it might be delayed just a little bit too. But no they don't wait. On the way back two days later the Charlotte flight was delayed twice then cancelled so I got a non-stop to Miami at 7 pm rather than my original 12.50 flight. More than 6 extra hours waiting in the airport with nothing offered to make up for it. Oh yes I got switched to American since they're now the same company but US airways personnel couldn't assign my seat and I had to wait until actual boarding to get a back row seat. I think I will avoid this airline in the future if at all possible! In-air personnel were very nice about fixing my drink the way I liked it so I'll rate them higher.,,,Economy,,1,3,5,3,3,,,2,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Shelly Clark,United States,6/3/2014,When I was traveling to Phoenix on 5/29/2014 I had purchased a ticket leaving Spokane at 9am in the morning and arriving at 11.30. However when I printed out my boarding pass it now showed that I was to arrive at the airport at 6am and arrive in Phoenix at 9.30am. I was now stuck at the airport for 5 hours! I was not notified of the change as had to scramble to find a new ride to the airport much earlier than I had expected! This is very inconvenient! There was no email or phone call to notify that this had changed. When I departed Phoenix on 6/1/2014 I again got my boarding pass and was told to proceed to gate B10. 10 minutes before my flight should have boarded myself and 5 other passengers were looking for someone at the gate for B10 no one was there! We flagged down another airport worker and were notified that our plane was now going out of gate A3! Again no notification email or update on the US Airways phone app to let us know that the gate had changed. As it was I and the other passengers had to run to make the flight departure at gate A3. I am physically able to do this. I know that an elderly passenger would not have been able to make it as it was quite a distance away in the terminal. This is not acceptable. Any changes and corrections in flight times and gates should be updated by US Airways on the website or an email/phone app should be notified. This should lay solely on US Airways to get this information out. As it stands this was my first and last flight with US Airways and I will go out of my way to NOT fly your airline again. I was not happy with these changes and the inconvenience it provided for me.,,,Economy,,,1,0,0,0,,,2,0

After spending a week with friendly helpful smiling people in Ireland I encountered the least friendly rudest crew I have ever seen on any flight. The flight wasn't just Americans returning home but Irish people flying to America for maybe the first time. What a terrible impression they must have made! First of all they were a mess - they didn't even appear clean. No one said hello how are you etc. Food service (and the food) was terrible. Two of the women flight attendants were arguing in the aisle over the beverage cart about how to dispose of cans. I asked for a cup of tea with milk and sugar and got one milk. When I asked for another milk you would have thought I asked her for champagne. I swear I saw some of them roll their eyes at people. When we arrived we were welcomed to Philadelphia by ""your Philadelphia-based crew"" - what a bunch of miserable unhappy impolite people. They are all in the wrong profession. On the way off the aircraft no one said goodbye have a nice day or anything. It was my worst flight experience ever. US Airways needs to work on customer service.

They then announce that the flight has been canceled and that we go visit the service desk. Almost about an hour wait. Once I got to talk to one of the service agents she was really rude and barely communicated with me. She then found me a flight 4 hours from then.

Baggage did not make the connection from Phil to Vegas. arrived some hours later. Cabin staff were unfriendly and quite rude. From Dublin We were sitting at the back of the plane and there was no selection of meal available and we were told ""thats what you get when you travel at the back"" . I opened my little tub of butter which had been heated to the extent that when I opened it it was in hot liquid and went all over my hand. I said to the stewardess who was passing by who could have brought me a napkin to wipe the liquid off my hands - but she sped by saying ""oh I know that happens"". Only that I had a tray of food on my lap she would have had more to deal with! We were told by cabin crew that all baggage was to be stored in the overhead lockers or underneath the seat in front. This obviously does not apply to cabin staff whose baggage was piled high on the back centre aisle seats of the plane it was not secured in any way. Their baggage was a danger to all the passengers in that area. Maybe the company should practice what they preach and put staff baggage in the hold. Cabin crew were ungroomed in appearance. Homeward bound to Dublin. Flight from Philadelphia to Orlando delayed resulting in us overnighting in Orlando  very grateful for the overnight accommodation provided at the Hyatt.

I paid the asking price for my ticket and purchased it long in advance of my flight. I was seated mid cabin on an aisle. There were 5 boarding groups called. How I ended up in the last Group 5 is beyond me. So I ended up stumbling over a planeload of passengers to get to my seat. Inflight I had the audacity to request a second beverage after finishing my first. I had paid for an inflight meal that was loaded with salt and needed a drink. As the flight attendant was passing through the aisle I politely asked for another beverage ""whenever you get the chance I know you're busy"". The reply: ""It won't be any time soon. Water and coffee only"". The same attendant walked past 3 times empty-handed before I asked a second attendant for the beverage. I received no reply and was really certain that I hadn't been heard. A few minutes later the drink arrived which is good and bad. Good: I got my drink. Bad: There seems to be no feeling by the attendants that passenger requests need be acknowledged.

The food was not great but not bad either and the same goes for the inflight service. The wine was unpalatable. IFE on the A330 was great - lots of new films. No IFE on the short flight but this is not expected. All in all - good flights and as expected. Nothing to get excited by.

They even checked bags at no cost to help speed along the process. Once on the flight things quickly deteriorated. People were packed in like sardines and we were asked to pay for sleeping packs. With little to no room to move it was a miserable 6 hrs. Once off the flight the customer service representative was incredibly rude when I asked to be placed on a stand by flight leaving sooner to my final destination. I was forcefully educated that just because U.S. Airways and American airways have merged you cannot schedule or a adjust American flights with U.S. Overall this experience was trying given how much I spent on flights.

I thought that this would be ample time to make my next flight but U.S. Airways missed the connection.

All in all I flew Paris- Charlotte Charlotte-Houston Houston-Dallas and Dallas-DC. I drove to Pennsylvania from DC. The day before my flight back to Paris I went online to check-in and noticed that I actually had to fly DC-Philly then Philly to Paris so I called US Airways to ask if I could simply check-in in Philly. They replied that this would be a $300 up-charge even though I was asking to eliminate a portion of my journey. I spoke with 3 customer service representatives and they all told me that since a direct flight was more expensive that I would need to pay more to fly less. It makes sense when booking a flight online that a direct journey would be more expensive than a non-direct one but at this point my seat was already reserved. I was told that this was 'impossible' and that if I didn't check-in in DC my whole flight would be cancelled.

On check in was informed of slight delay but told to go through anyway. Once through security clearance boards showed 7 hours delay on flight. I went to Customer service desk to ask what would happen about connections or overnight accommodation at Philadelphia as it seemed likely that I'd miss any connections that day. Customer service agent told me they had no idea when the flight would actually leave but that of course they'd honour the connection as it wasn't my fault and that it would all be worked out once we were airborne. She could tell me nothing because she had no information at all. So I decided to make use of the otherwise wasted time working on my PC in the executive lounge. About 2 hours later the flight disappeared from the display boards. I went back to the customer service desk to find it closed! There was a sign giving a phone number to call - which I did the person on the other end told me she couldn't book me on to any alternative flights - somehow I was too late in the queue and all available seats had already been allocated and she expected me to be pleased with the fact that she'd booked me onto the following days flight 24 hours later. No offer of overnight accommodation or transport back home overnight. When I asked about my bags she told me to ask at the ticket desk the other side of security (ie landside rather than airside). So I exited the departures area back to the check-in area only to find the customer service desk closed with a sign up saying anyone affected by the flight cancellation should call the number I'd already been talking to.

But after a delay following a delay following a delay I missed my connection. The first thing the US Airways representative told me and he was a manager was that I should fly Delta.

Inflight entertainment was average seating as expected for economy class food was satisfactory but as a vegetarian I do not find it acceptable that the airline had run out of vegetarian options. I then had to wait a while for a vegetarian option to arrive. Landing was smooth arriving an hour later than scheduled meant there was not enough time to complete customs and security checks. Upon arriving at customs we were greeted by a spiralling queue of extremely anxious passengers customs were unable to manage the large quantity of passengers this resulted in us waiting for more than 1 hour no provision made for late arriving passengers to be fast tracked through customs to allow us to board our connecting flight. We were reassured that the flight would not take off without us. We ran to the gate displayed on the departures board and when we arrived at our gate we were disappointed to find that the flight had taken off without us. We waited to speak to a customer service representative for over 2 hours. We asked to be put on the next available flight and got no response was booked onto 10am flight the next morning. I asked where we would stay for the next 12 hours staff member shrugged. We walked away from customer services feeling so disappointed. We spent the night in the airport.

On our flight back from San Juan to PHL the lady at the desk seated my daughter and I 5 rows apart on the connecting flight from PHL to LaGuardia. I did not realize this until 5 minutes later and went back to the same lady. Her answer - ""Oh just ask one of the passengers they'll switch seats with you."" The flight from San Juan to PHL was delayed because of ""bad weather conditions"". When we got to PHL an hour late our connecting flight to LA Guardia in NYC had already left. Another rude US Airways employee gave us tickets for a flight the next morning and as already mentioned above told us they would neither help find transportation nor a hotel. Because of their guidelines they would not release our luggage so now we are in NYC where we got at 4 am. US Airways have no customer service.",,,Economy,,,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,N Giesenhagen,United States,4/21/2014,We were on our way home from San Francisco to Salt Lake City and we had a one hour layover in Phoenix. When we got to San Francisco we had already got the call that our flight was delayed 35 minutes. We tried to get on another flight but none were available. When we were checking in it was very hard to get some help because for some reason the kiosk let myself check my bag but not my friend. It took a good 10 minutes to get any help and we just kept getting walked past. Got to the gate and the plane ended up being delayed for 50 minutes now. When we got to Phoenix we had 5 minutes to get to our next flight. Turns out they changed the gate last minute and instead of only having to go from gate A10 to A12 we had to go from about A20 to B2 in 5 minutes. My friend and I sprinted from our gate to get to the next one and we arrived with one minute before they close the doors (since they close them 10 minutes before departure) The door was closed and there wasn't a sole around. I went to the next gate and I explained our flight was delayed twice and there was a last minute gate change. Very rudely she told me she was aware and then went back to talking to her friend. The customer service agent was not helpful at all as well and was very rude. No one apologized and we had to stay in Phoenix that night because no more flights were going out until 7am then next morning. I will never fly with US Airways again.,,,Economy,,1,0,2,0,0,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,D Graubard,United States,4/19/2014,ORD-PHL-YQB (Quebec City). A320 to PHL - maybe only 45 people on the plane so boarding was quick and we departed the gate early. Flight Attendants were very personable and not what I usually get on US Airways. Maybe the merger with AA is a good thing. Drink service was offered and otherwise FA's walked the aisle a few times for trash. Landing was smooth and great views of Philadelphia. Bus transfer to commuter gates - its strange that if you want to walk to that concourse you have to recheck through TSA but they have a bus transfer that keeps you within security. YQB flight was a CR7 and packed - but FA was nice. Left 20 min late but arrived just 1-2 min late. Overall a nice flight. I know they don't offer inflight entertainment but so many people have their own Ipads and Ipods and such - its not that big of a deal. Keep up the good work.,,,Economy,,8,4,4,0,2,,,4,1
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Brian Keane,United States,4/17/2014,US Airways is the worst. Their flights out of New Orleans are oversold so if you don't check in at least 30 minutes before your flight you will be bumped. I tried to get my boarding pass from the computer about 28 minutes before departure time and it could not be done. I spoke to the agent and they said that I had to rebook to another flight. I begged and they said no. They put me on a later flight and I go through security and my original flight was still at the gate for 20 minutes! They had already given away my seat and I couldn't board. Zero customer service. Horrible for business travel. I will go out of my way to avoid US Air.,,,Economy,,,1,1,1,1,,,1,0

We arrived at the gate of our connecting flight in Charlotte NC just as they were closing the gate although we were there 10 min prior to takeoff. I explained that we were flying down for a funeral which we would miss if we were delayed. The gate attendant told me I was 30 seconds late and not getting on the flight. My return flight was delayed 1.5 hours and the connecting return flight sat on the runway for 45 minutes. It appears that exceptions to delay are only made when it is to benefit their company and not for their paying customers. I will never again fly US Airways!,,,Economy,,,3,1,0,0,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,D Mackmin,United States,4/16/2014,Flew to the Dominican Republic from Detroit 4/4 with a stop in Philadelphia. First flight 40 minutes late had to literally run with 2 kids through the airport to make our connection in Philly. Didn't realize there was no need to run because that flight was delayed also. Boarded 45 minutes late sat on the plane for 30 minutes at which time they made everyone get off the plane. Sat in the waiting are for another hour while they attended to 'broken seats'. Flew home on 4/10 - flight delayed in DR for 1.5 hours with no explanation. Only had a 2 hour lay over in Philly where we also had to go through immigration and customs. Again we managed to make our connection only because the flight from Philly to Detroit was late again. That's 4 flights - all delayed. Don't you think if you have 20-30 passengers who are on the verge of missing their connecting flights that they would have those people get off the plane first? They couldn't have cared one iota. I will never fly US Air again nor would I recommend it to anyone. I can't rate the Inflight Entertainment because there wasn't any.

Honestly I wasn't excited about having been assigned to this flight/carrier. Once on the aircraft there was a noticeable change from its US domestic counterpart there was personal AVOD at each seat head with ample choices for the long flight the seats had ample leg room and appeared wide and comfy. The flight crew were friendly and quick to please and even did a walk through picking up trash that had accumulated on the deck (rare for a US carrier). The international product that US Airways offers has left a positive impression and I won't be hesitant to fly this airline in the future. The A330-300 was spacious and smooth in flight.,,,Economy,,10,5,5,5,5,,,5,1

Despite logging in on-line and assigning seats together a week or so beforehand and checking on the day of the flight my wife and I ended up at different ends of the cabin which wasn't really how we wanted to spend our honeymoon. The check-in staff were essentially useless fobbing us off onto the gate staff. At the gate they were friendly but it was too late to be able to sort anything out by that stage. Eventually we were able to swap seats with the person next to my wife after she took pity on us. The actual flight was rather miserable with no entertainment food and uncomfortable seats essentially like doing a long haul flight but on a budget European carrier. Certainly will avoid them in US Airways in the future.,,,Economy,,4,2,2,1,1,,,3,0

I had booked my redeye flight from PHX to EWR nearly 3 weeks in advance. I chose a window seat. After checking in to my flight at the airport I realized I was assigned a middle seat. Since I had arrived 4 hours before departure I was the first person at my gate. The gate agent was curt. It was almost time to board there was still no gate agent to be found. 80% of my fellow passengers myself included found out through word-of-mouth of a gate change. I grabbed my belongings and ran from A18 to A25 eager to restore my original seat assignment. However I had hardly introduced my situation before the new gate agent cut me off and said ""Sorry no room."" The customer service agent could not have been more indifferent and reluctant to do her job. I went back to my gate where my flight had been delayed more than 2 hours. There was yet another unannounced gate change. Finally it was time to board. Despite sitting in the 13th row I was in the last boarding group and thus was forced to gate-check my bag which now reassured that I would be late to work in the morning.

They claim to be the New American Airlines but when you go to check-in they send you to the Disaster that used to be USAir. Planes are out of date. Even the newer ones have very small overheads for carry ons but people take as much as possible on board. Then they cram as many possible on the plane. Flight from Hawaii has no service. Expensive food if you have to buy from them and not worth it. We had short connection and no chance to buy in airport.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Joel McLean,United States,4/6/2014,My wife and I live in NC near Wilmington. US Airways is one of the few airlines that fly out of ILM airport so we have flown with them numerous times. My wife flew to Ohio for a two week visit. The return flight as it was listed on the flight itinerary was to fly from Cleveland OH (CLE) to Charlotte NC (CLT) have about an hour lay over and then fly onto ILM. The flight was supposed to be into CLT on flight 1955 and out again on the same flight an hour later. This seemed odd since US Airways typically lands at one end of CLT and has you fly out of another gate all the way across the terminal. We questioned this flight into and out of the same gate when we purchased the tickets when she went to board her flight in ILM to go to CLE and again in CLE when boarding to return. All three times we were told that was accurate. The flight from CLE was delayed due to weather for 35 minutes and landed in CLT about 50 minutes late. People were scrambling to make connections as this was the last flight of the day (about 11 pm). My wife made a comment to one of the flight crew that she was lucky since she just had to stay on the same plane. The staff member told her that plane wasn't going anywhere for the rest of the night. US Airways had changed her flight plans while she was in the air. The flight she had to catch was only 8 gates away but it had already boarded and was pulling away by that time. She was stranded in CLT for the night. I ended up driving the 3.5 hours one way to pick her up to save her from having to sleep in the terminal. I would highly recommend that if you have any options other than US Airways for making flight plans you do it. Even if you have to pay a little extra for a ticket the peace of mind will be worth it.,,,Economy,,,3,1,0,0,,,1,0

We were given the option of flying the next two booked flights standby or cancelling and applying for a refund.

I received an email regarding our outbound flight that I needed to contact customer service because our reservations were ""out of sync."" I spent 25 minutes on hold getting that straightened out and the person told me I should go online and print out our boarding passes. I could only find my husband's flight. I called back and was told that was because I had new confirmation number which the prior person didn't give me. I went back online and found out we were no longer sitting together. I called back again and was told I could pay extra for a premium seat otherwise there was nothing they could do. She told me the gate agent would be “happy to help.” That conversation took an additional 30 minutes. When we got to the airport and I asked about sitting together and the employee was very rude saying she would ""try to get us together for this 20 minute flight."" I explained it was the second leg I was asking about. She got us closer but not together. She could have put us in a “premium”seat together but would not without us paying additional money.

The pilot informed us that there were ""operational"" problems and they were making him turn the plane around to go back to the gate because our flight was cancelled. After the rush of everyone to customer service we proceeded to stand in line for 45 minutes. At that point one of the three agents they had behind the desk decided that would be the best time to grab her book and go on break. The agent who decided to actually do her job put us on a flight to Jacksonville (3 hours from our original destination - Tallahassee). Never once was there an apology or offer to provide meals or anything. I had checked my bag in so I made sure to reiterate to her I needed my bag re-directed. She assured me my bag had been re-directed. We proceeded to sit in the airport for another 4 hours. Our plane to JAX was late so the agent hurried all customers to the plane. Finally we got on the plane and landed in JAX at 10.15 pm. My bag was not there. After waiting in line until 11 pm to speak to an agent about I learned that my bag had never in fact been re-directed and this agent's ""best guess"" was that it was still in DC.",,,Economy,,,1,1,0,0,,,1,0

Prior to boarding saw three employees of US Airways access the plane before boarding called. When boarding announced we joined the line to check-in however told that whilst my wife was checked into Envoy I had been bumped back to coach as the flight was full as a person who missed a flight on previous day was being placed into my seat! Re assigned a coach seat despite my request to remain in Envoy. As I asked more questions the reason for my downgrade (despite confirmed and paid for Envoy seat) changed over and over again. Basically I was not provided with the correct reason and was just treated with no respect. As I was pulled from the line much embarrassment to me as people assumed some issue with me as a passenger. My wife confirmed that the three US airline employees were in Envoy. Appalling service and ruined what was outbound a great service.

We managed to beg a TSA agent who hustled us through security and we ran to the gate. Got to the gate just after it pushed off so we missed the flight. An hour later we found out that not only were we not put on the next flight we couldn't even get a flight until 10 am the next day.

We somehow managed to make it to our Philly connecting flight and on to our Puerto Rican cruise. If at all possible I will not fly US Airways again!,,,Economy,,,3,5,1,1,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,H Sebastien,Belgium,3/4/2014,I flew from Brussels (Belgium) to Fort Lauderdale and back on 16th Feb and 24th. I was supposed to take connecting flights via Philadelphia and Charlotte on both trips. I actually missed my first connection on my way to FLL due to the long security lines the customs control and the baggage re-checking in PHL. I arrived just a few minutes after my flight to CLT had closed and a very rude lady didn't want to let me board the plane even though it was still sitting at the gate. She directed me to the customer service desk in a rude manner. I still made it to FLL by boarding a direct flight in the evening thanks to the professional US Airways customer service lady that rebooked me straight away. I didn't have any problems with my connecting flights on my way back to Brussels. US Airways have poor cabin crew service very limited in-flight entertainment (operated by old Boeing 767s). I have read many reviews about this airline before flying with them and I was expecting to have some problems. I would not recommend this airline to someone traveling in the future.,,,Economy,,2,3,2,2,1,,,2,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,B Orth,United States,2/25/2014,Yesterday morning we began our return flight to central New York from a lovely vacation in Orlando. We boarded the first leg to Philadelphia without incident around 7.30 am. As we were preparing to land a crew member announced that Philadelphia was fogged in and not allowing any craft to land or take off. After 30 minutes it was announced that the plane was being diverted to Richmond for refuelling. An uneventful 45-minute flight and then it was announced that there was some trouble refuelling. Another hour on the tarmac and we took off for Philly. Upon landing we made our way to the regional terminal to continue our trip to Ithaca which was still posted as ‘on time. The boarding was switched from gate to gate 3 times. Our departure time was changed twice and finally the flight cancelled. We stood in line at a US Airways gate and told to go to a service desk for help. We stood in line a long line for another 30 minutes at the service desk to be met by a staff member who told us that she could get us standby on a flight Monday (this was Friday at 3 pm.). The customer service representative offered nothing other than a 3 day wait. There were many things that could have been done to make the experience right. Ground transportation offer of a hotel a little compassion but what we got was nothing no help at all. We will not fly US Airways again.,,,Economy,,,3,1,0,0,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Anna Goldshteyn,United States,2/25/2014,"This review is based on the first and only experience with US Airways. I usually fly 4-6 times per year and would not hold the airline responsible for weather related delays. Unfortunately the airline is not prepared to handle emergencies of any kind. I was supposed to fly February 14 to Costa Rica flight was cancelled as I was proceeding to board due to ""mechanical issues"" rescheduled to Sunday. I lost 3 days of vacation without reimbursement. Coming back on February 23rd my connecting flight from Costa Rica was delayed by 30 minutes. The airline refused to accommodate or even hold the connecting flight. I had to go through Customs recheck the bag and run to anther terminal all under 45 minutes. I arrived at the gate 10 minutes before scheduled departure time panting only to find that my seat was given up to someone else and was I rebooked to the following morning. The Customer Service at US Airways handed me a number for the hotel very nonchalant since it was the end of her shift and she was ready to head home. I on the other hand paid for the cab checked into a hotel at my own expense. Customer service is completely lacking.",,,Economy,,,3,3,2,1,,,1,0

I found this airline to be good on time boarding staff were very good. They came around with beverage service and then tea and coffee about an hour before landing in Turks. Coming back to Boston yesterday was a disaster I know it's school vacation week but the service at Providenciales Airport was extremely slow almost causing us to miss our flight to Boston. The service onboard yesterday's flight to Boston was minimal. They only came around with beverage service once. No service for tea and coffee.

We paid extra for what we thought was economy plus but there was no more leg room than in coach. Of course US Air has no inflight entertainment. There was not enough food for purchase on the way down. Flight attendants urged us to complain to US Air on the net about it. Flight attendants were great and very apologetic about the lack of food. On the return flight we were about 3 hours late due to a mechanical problem. I fly United Delta Virgin America Jet Blue and US Air a decent amount.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,K Wright,United Kingdom,2/20/2014,Flew Manchester UK to Philadelphia and then on to Miami return - Economy. Very good experience on all 4 flights. All flights left on time and either arrived on time or early. US Airways use A330 wide body from Manchester to Philadelphia with 2-4-2 seating which is great for couples as you can easily get 2 seats together. US airways website lets you choose your seats as soon as you book for free unlike lots of the other major airlines (e.g. BA) which charge economy class to pre book seats. Plenty of leg room and space around seats. Great inflight entertainment on Manchester to Philadelphia leg with personal video screen and on demand movies TV and games. Lots of films to choose from. Food ok - usual airline offering. No better or worse than all the rest. Soft drinks tea and coffee are free throughout the flight. Free wine with meal but there is a charge after that plus there is a charge for other alcoholic drinks. Staff attentive and efficient. Flight from Philadelphia to Miami on A321 - lots of leg room but no IFE - only a couple of hours so no problem. No charge for soft drinks/tea/coffee but there is a charge for food or alcohol. All in all a good experience - would always use US airways from Manchester to the US rather than American BA United or Delta as IFE superior and they use wide body aircraft. Immigration/customs and change of planes in Philadelphia is easy and quick.,,,Economy,,10,5,4,3,5,,,4,1

Going in I was very optimistic that everything was going to be fine and we would land in St. Kitts the same day. I was wrong. When we got to the gate we were kindly informed that our flight had been delayed 4 hours because the ""crew needed more rest."" They also informed us that we were going to miss our connecting flight to St Kitts from Charlotte and that we wouldn't be able to catch a flight until next Friday to St. Kitts as they have very limited booking. After switching to another airline entirely we got a flight to St. Kitts the next day and we were on our way. Once on the U.S. Airways flight to Charlotte the captain informed us that they ""knew the flight would be delayed the night before."" If U.S. Airways had informed us the night before instead of a half an hour before our flight was supposed to leave then we might've been able to get another flight to connect to the flight to St. Kitts.

Of course the flight in was in a separate terminal so the time to get from one gate to the other was a 30 minute ordeal. Needless to say of the 4 passengers that were to connect none made it. When I arrived at the connecting gate after running across the entire Phoenix airport I was greeted by a very non caring gate crew. They immediately asked me if I was connecting from Palm Springs and when I said yes the gate rep just said that the flight was closed and I have to take another flight. I asked if they knew we were coming in from Palm Springs and they knew the plane had landed and they knew we were all coming from about a mile away then why on earth would they not hold the door an extra ten minutes.

Our rescheduled flight was for 7.30 am the next morning and when we arrived it said it was on time for 8.45am.

They then double booked my grandfathers seat and tried to move him out of first class. On our way back we sat in line for 3.5 hours to check in because the system had crashed and the flight was delayed 2 hours just so that they could check everyone in which meant I almost missed my connecting flight.

A two hour 10 minute flight in first ranks a cardboard cup of coffee and a bag of potato chips! The second leg was delayed due to technical problems then when ready to leave a drunken passenger had to be removed on the insistence of a passenger (the attendant said he knew he was drunk but not how much) and then the plane developed a mechanical problem necessitating a plane change. 4 hours late and what did first class passengers get for their now 7 plus hour trip-yes you guessed it a bag of chips and a drink. They should be banned from Star Alliance Membership until a new experienced in customer service CEO is hired. Clearly this is the fault of the Executive not the cabin crew.

The attendants' facial expressions body language and polite curtness spoke of barely held in tension. In addition to that passengers were herded onto the plane managed like we were an inconvenience (again politely but still the feeling was there) and the plane itself was dirty.

This flight left much to be desired as everything from the hard to soft product are abysmal. Domestic first seats are unbearably uncomfortable to sleep in with the angle recline only going down about 3-5 inches. As for the on board amenities free alcohol and few select chips just doesn't cut it though they do offer meals on non red-eye flights from what I've been told. It gets even better as the sad excuse of a blanket they provided for sleep was a thin fabric that can easily be mistaken for as a table cloth. Club access in Phoenix was granted with *G and much like the flight it left a lot to be desired as well - stale crackers unappealing soup and choices of free and paid drinks.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,M Martin,United States,12/17/2013,I've been flying US Airways for nearly 3 months. Four flights per week for a total of 48. Nearly half of them have been delayed due to some sort of mechanical issue. These issues always take much longer than the expected amount of time to the point that I have missed 10 connections in that period. Two weeks ago I flew IAH to CLT to see my flight to SAV was delayed by 30 minutes then 1 hour then cancelled without explanation. Customer service offered a flight at 9 pm 12 hours later. In fact I'm currently on board a flight to CLT that cannot depart because the plane has had ice for an hour and a half. Rather than moving to have the plane de-iced at the north end of the airport they attempted to fix it with a heating truck then a second one. The crew has been unsympathetic throughout and I'm frankly tired of it. Unfortunately I'm not in charge of booking my business flights.

She assured me that it would not be a problem because of my flight time. So I made no arrangements to rebook anything. That quickly turned out to be a lie. We started with a delayed flight out of DFW 1.5 hours delayed while we waited on the plane to be de-iced. We finally arrive with passengers that had connections to Richmond and Denver. Due to the delay our planed landed 5-10 minutes too late to make the connection. Both planes were still at the gates. But instead of holding the planes by 5-10 minutes which by the way would not have caused any disruption of service because all of the planes that had connections were the last flights of the day. Instead a conscious decision was made to deliberately force all of the passengers to miss their planes and have to incur hotel food and transportation expenses. I was one of the first passengers to be turned away. The gate agent was still at the gate the plane was still at the gate but she said they had shut the door and I was stuck for the night. I then got in line and was stuck on the next flight and sent on my way. The next day I get to the gate. It is a full flight and everyone in group 4 and 5 are told they can only have 1 bag or personal item. I checked with the agent and made sure that it was okay for me to have my laptop bag and my shopping bag. Then at the gate I was told that I could not take my laptop bag. Instead I had to take both of my laptops out check my laptop bag and then crush my designed hand bag and pastries by cramming them under the seat with my unprotected laptops. It seemed like every step of the way every agent of USAir intentionally tried to make this the worst possible trip possible.,,,Economy,,,2,1,0,0,,,1,0

We were unable to use the ticket for flight from DC to Orlando and U SAirways canceled our return tickets from Orlando to DC. I found this out when I tried to check in online for the return flight.

At check in they gave me seat 24 which was the worst though 8E had been confirmed by US Air. They said that they have no obligation to provide the confirmed seat of my choice! Strongly complained to supervisor via phone and asked for aisle seat for my return flight on the 8/12/2013. He said plane was almost full and the best he could do was give me an aisle seat row again 24. Plane was 1/3 full practically empty and at PHL airport I was given row 12. Inflight service both ways far below average no comments on food.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,A Tyler,United States,12/9/2013,I flew from Honolulu to PHX and PHX back to Honolulu. I was very disappointed with this airline my first impression was horrible. Going to PHX from HNL the flight attendants on US airways were very rude and unprofessional. The aircraft that services HNL is always the 757. It was very squashed no wifi 3 by 3 seating configuration on the left and right side thus no room to move around. The interior of the plane was falling apart tray tables did not at all stay in the lock position. Lighting everything seemed out dated. Meal service was horrible you have to pay for meals where as on Hawaiian Airlines all meals are complimentary. Coming back from PHX to HNL flight attendant and customer service was very outstandingly rude. We were delayed 1 hour because we had to wait on a US air flight attendant who was late. This is unacceptable.,,,Economy,,,1,1,4,2,,,3,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Katharine Coyne,United States,12/9/2013,My son had a very expensive round-trip ticket for Thanksgiving break: Spokane to Los Angeles with transfers in Phoenix. We confirmed the flights online. We tried to check in at the airport on Dec 1 for the return flight at least 30 min early (6am). My son had only one carry-on and a backpack. Theoretically he could use the automatic kiosk to get his boarding pass and go directly through security. They had already sold his ticket. The woman behind the counter wasted our time. It took 10 more minutes to call the supervisor. They were rude and told us we should have been there 45 min early. They gave my son a standby ticket for flights when the Phoenix transfer was at 9pm with no chance of getting aboard. That would mean he would be sitting at the airport from 6am to 9pm! I had to pay a change of flight fee $225 plus $250 for the next day.,,,Economy,,,0,1,0,0,,,1,0

All four of our flights were on time and the connections were all within the same terminal which was a plus. The staff were friendly on every flight as well. On our last flight the airplane didn't have enough seats due to a smaller airplane than expected so all the passengers in the last ten rows had to be put on different flights. It was obviously an inconvenience but they did a phenomenal job handling it. They immediately put us on another flight that was leaving at the exact same time got an airport cart to take us to our new terminal gave us each $200 vouchers and delivered our luggage to our home. They were so kind and apologetic what more can anyone ask for!,,,Economy,,9,4,4,4,2,,,5,1

When I got to the airport at Myrtle the lady at the counter told me my flight was not leaving until 4.50 because of a ""mechanical error."" I received no notification or email. She put me on a 10 pm flight to LGA without my consent. This is absolutely unacceptable for an airline. She refused to tell me that there were earlier flights available so I looked myself and found a flight on Delta which left 3 hours earlier. The staff at US Airways are so unsympathetic and simply do not care about the customers. I recommend flying any other airline unless US airways is your only option.

I drove to Phoenix to catch my second flight and got there on time but was not able to get on that flight because they already gave away my tickets. Mind you economy class over $2.5k for 2 tickets and then you get pushed around whichever way! I wonder whether you just turned around and ripped someone off to sell my tickets and then reschedule me for an overnight trip! Not to mention that the rest of the service was not that hot either.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Paul Obyrne,Ireland,11/29/2013,I started flying with US Airways a few years ago when they offered competitive business class (envoy) fares from Ireland and received a Dividend Miles Gold Card from them two years ago. On 9th November 2013 I flew first class on an internal flight from Tampa to Charlotte. I had to pay $50 to spend one hour in the US Airways Club in Tampa airport a lounge that does not offer a shower facility. The fact that I was flying first class and holding a US Airways Dividend Miles gold card was irrelevant to the staff at the reception desk there. I will never fly with US Airways again.,,,First Class,,3,4,3,3,0,,,3,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,M Capozzi,United States,11/29/2013,We flew with one-stop from Boston to Phoenix and then Phoenix to Maui Hawaii. Each leg of the trip was about 6 hours so we splurged for 1st Class assuming it would be more comfortable and have full amenities one would expect at $1300 per seat (one way). Pulled out my headphones but found nowhere on the seat to plug into? Was told there were no music TV movies or other entertainment options. Wi-Fi was offered at a price but it still would not allow for any streaming services so what's the point? Staff were polite and matter of fact. Meal was mediocre even for airline food. No complaint with the beverage service they realize it's the best way to medicate you. We eventually had 3 each and fell asleep. We had about 40 minutes between flights and they didn't announce the gates for connecting flights at the end of the flight as many airlines do for their passenger's convenience. On the ground in Phoenix we learned that the gate for our second flight to Maui was clear on the other side of the airport so we hurried with our carry-ons to the far end some 30 gates away. As soon as we got there they announced a gate change that flight which required us to rush right back across the entire airport again to the gate area where we had started at!! Everyone already at the gate bolted for the far end of the airport along with us. Insane. Even Jet Blue economy is a better flight experience. We will never use this airline again.,,,First Class,,3,4,4,3,1,,,1,0

Return FLL to PHL on an Embraer 195 first time on this plane and very good experience 2 plus 2 seating in economy. Club Lounge at PHL was an excellent oasis although not a patch on BA or Virgin lounges. A332 in Envoy for trip back to UK was great again although staff on this flight not as good and the food served was lukewarm and attention to detail was lacking bread offered after you had eaten the main course! Breakfast omelette and sausage was good.

Departure from SDF-CLT was on a day with miserable weather but US made it out and I made the connection with maybe 1-2 minutes to spare. The LGA terminal is really a pleasure to use with short lines and a nice amount of space near the gates. Staff service was good throughout.

Oakland - Phoenix - New York - Phoenix - Oakland. Eastbound Oakland and westbound New York flights were both late departing (the latter by more than one hour). Nearly missed my eastbound Phoenix connection and actually did miss my westbound connecting Phoenix flight due to late departure from NYC. My Westbound flight took nearly 11 hours from NYC to Oakland. I could have flown to Europe in that amount of time (less actually). Promised meal eastbound was not provided after all.

The service was OK but nothing special almost surly. PHL-VCE in business class: we had to wait to be airborne before the inflight entertainment was switched the headphones and the TV screens installed in the individual cradles. Once that was done the selection was rather limited. The service was OK the attendants did what they had to do but there was no enthusiasm in what they were doing overall above all considering that the plane was half empty in both classes. The food was actually tasty and well presented. The seats a bit temperamental to begin with and then not too comfortable: they didn't flat out completely so not too conducive to sleeping. The lounge in PHL was nice but the food selection there was extremely limited surely if compared to other StarAlliance lounges around the world.,,,Business Class,,7,3,3,4,3,,,3,0

It looked like I made it but when I tried to give my boarding pass to the lady she very coldly told me I was too late.

My goal when flying is to get from point A to point B and be somewhat on time. With US Airways my flights have always been as scheduled. Seats are a bit more spacious than with other airlines too.

The Envoy suites are very comfortable fully flat and private (particularly if you get the individual window seats) and are in fact very similar to AAs new business class flat beds on their new B777-300s or Qatars B787. However the US Airways seats are clearly a more budget version with smaller TV screens etc (but just as comfy for sleeping). Reasonable selection of films and the food was not bad at all. Excellent value- Booked less than a week before departure and this was the same price (slightly less in fact) as a full price Premium Economy fair on BA so absolutely no competition and would choose again without hesitation.,,,Business Class,,8,5,3,4,4,,,5,1

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Fred Pollack,United States,11/5/2013,I have been flying for over 50 years and I can honestly say that my recent round trip flight on US Airways from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv was the worst airline experience I have ever had. The first leg of this trip was from Los Angeles to Philadelphia when I got on the plane I looked around to plug in my earphones to hear some music but the stewardess informed me that this flight did not have any way to either listen to music or watch a video. In addition all food had to be purchased. The second leg of the trip was a 12 hour flight from Philadelphia to Tel Aviv. The TV screen on the back of the seat in front of me did not work and when I told the steward he attempted to fix it but he was unsuccessful consequently I sat in a cramped seat for over 12 hours with no music or video. When they served breakfast there were two choices: eggs or blintzes - I asked for eggs but I was told that they were out of eggs and when I asked the steward to check the other aisle to see if there were any eggs left he became angry. Unfortunately the blintzes were covered with a sickeningly sweet jam which made them inedible. I will never fly US Airways again.,,,Premium Economy,,1,2,2,1,1,,,1,0

Gogo wireless was a nice touch but it wasn't always reliable and was also a bit pricey - $17 for a day pass? The fact that they overbook bothers me.

The first three legs of our journey were OK - average service but on-time arrivals but the last leg was a nightmare. Our flight was cancelled after a 4-hour delay and while cancellations happen to all airlines the way US Airways handled this one was appalling. Gate agents could not operate their own ticketing system to rebook passengers baggage was delivered two hours late and to a carousel in a different terminal and US Airways employees had no idea what was going on and were generally indifferent to passenger needs. We were traveling with an infant yet were given a hotel 15 minutes away when there was another hotel connected to the airport that other families received.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,M Cameron,United Kingdom,10/22/2013,We flew GLA-PHL on time with good service then the PHL-MCO connection was delayed due to a crew member being late 30-45mins delay. After a wonderful holiday in Orlando checked in at 11.30 in good time for our 3.05 flight to PHL then went through security and to the gate departure screens said our flight would be delayed to 4.20 so it would not arrive in PHL until 18.20. Told we would miss our connection to GLA leaving at 18.40pm. They told us that the problem was another crew related issue! They rebooked us on plane departing PHL at 21.55 and arriving LHR at 10.00 the next morning then book us on a British Airways flight to GLA leaving at 12.10 arriving at 13.55 we would have originally been in GLA at 7.00 am but did not arrive till 14.00pm. When questioned US Airways said that there compensation policy is to just rebook passengers ASAP on the next flight available. The plane going from MCO-PHL an A330 did not have any inflight entertainment on this route despite having seat back TV's. That happened to be the same plane taking us to LHR but on that journey there was in-flight entertainment. So would not use US again unless desperate and would not recommend.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,John van Dalen,United States,10/22/2013,PHL-PBI was the last leg on my first-class round trip to and from PSP. I had boarded USAir in Palm Springs that morning and flew to Phoenix. So far so good. Then I flew Phoenix to Philadelphia. That's where it all fell apart. I was stranded at Philadelphia airport by US Airways when their last flight of the day departed early leaving 3 connecting passengers abandoned. Dealing with the brick wall that is the US Airways customer service staff my treatment was shameful disrespectful and costly. USAir refused to rebook me because my reservation had been made via United Airlines. United told me that since my reservation was a First Class Mileage Award the first compatible seat they could rebook me on was next Monday (5 days hence)! Consequently I had to put myself up at the Sheraton in Philadelphia for the night and pay $508 to buy a one-way ticket from PHL-PBI. Adding insult to expensive injury the flight I was supposed to take was first-class non-stop. This one-way rip-off ticket was in coach and had a layover in Charlotte. On just this website alone and going back only about 8 weeks I have encountered reviews of no less than a dozen passengers who have been stranded or treated miserably in Philadelphia by USAir. Coincidence? I don't think so. It is my belief that when an airline accepts your ticket to get from point A to point B that it assumes its share of responsibility for getting their passengers to their destination. I had already flown 2 out of the 3 legs of my flight that day. Departing early and stranding three connecting passengers is unconscionable.,,,First Class,,,3,1,3,1,,,1,0

My only complaint is the food both ways the offering was chicken with rice or pasta surely they can come up with more choice than this also a muffin for breakfast is not much to offer. One other gripe I have but this is not exclusively US airways but all American carriers why are passengers allowed to take such large baggage in the cabin some suitcases were bigger than mine that went in the hold.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,J Fairclough,France,10/20/2013,"BCN to JAX rtn via PHL. Philadelphia Airport seems to come in for a lot of stick on this forum but you can only speak as you find and my wife and I found it a very pleasant improvement to the likes of JFK MIA and LAX as regards transfers. More space and less like a cattle market. Paid to go in the US Club which was very pleasant and well worth twenty odd dollars. Only waited 5 mins to clear immigration which is far less than anywhere else we've encountered in the States. As for US Airways well we've now been on all of the ""big four"" in the last couple of years (first time with US) and to be honest I really cannot see any difference in any of them. In all four in economy space is getting tighter and tighter and food/drink on offer is getting less and less and poorer and poorer quality. But if people want low fares then there's the rub I guess. At least US run modern planes (A-330 200's) on this route with Emb 175 on the domestic sector far better than poky CRJ's etc. The Airbus is far better than the triple sevens or the ancient 747s or 767s used by some and at least if you are travelling as a couple you just get two seats and don't have to share. AVOD in all seats which is better than many. Overall still miles behind people like Air New Zealand but they are only of any use if you want somewhere out West. In short as long as you don't expect luxury from any of these American giants you won't be disappointed.

Closed the flight early with no announcement that I could hear as I was rushing to the gate. They knew I wasn't on board and my bag was or wasn't.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,B Ridley,United Kingdom,10/18/2013,So many bad points that I'm not sure they will all fit! 1) Do not pay for 'preferred' access. I forget exactly what the name is but I paid$ 31 for this in order to board the airplane 'early' but was told by the attendant that it didn't mean anything just go by the zone number. 2) The food ran out and I was told I could pre-order but when I tried to do this for my return flight I couldn't as the website only listed the food but there wasn't a way to actually order and pay for it. 3) This has already been said but the seats are extremely uncomfortable. I purchased seats by the window so I could lean against them to sleep as I had to travel from the UK to AZ. In total I paid an additional $267 for these seats but I shouldn't have bothered as the space between the seat and the window was so far that I couldn't lean against it at all. 4) The return plane 'broke down' and so we had to wait approximately 4 extra hours this was at night and the airline graciously gave us a $10 voucher for a meal while we waited but the voucher was only good for shops in the airport but it was so expensive all I was able to buy was a bottle of water and a bag of chips. 4) Because of the plane braking down I was going to miss the coach (bus) in London that would take me home and I had already paid for it. I will never travel on US Airways again.,,,Economy,,1,1,3,2,3,,,2,0

An older 767 from Philadelphia to Dublin in Envoy. Good service wonderful meals- likely the best airline I have flown for the quantity of food - you are not left hungry. Choice of 4 meals and a hot breakfast choice too. On time and overall good. Return to Philadelphia on the same aircraft in Envoy. Really great service and food was outstanding. Philadelphia to Halifax on a new Embraer and very comfortable. Overall this airline does a great job in my experience (this was my second trip to Dublin this year with them).

us-airways,US Airways customer review,M Ramsey,United States,10/13/2013,Very inconvenient. They have a smart phone app that you can do everything on except print a boarding pass. When you arrive at the airport you have to either go to the regular or wait in the self serve kiosk line both of which are very long. We checked in on the app had to wait in line to get a boarding pass so we could check our bags. Bag fees are $25 each. If you want a choice of seats that is $45 per person. If you want expedited boarding that is another $25 per person. Our flight was about 2 1/2 hours long. We were not offered snacks to purchase. We got one tiny cup of water/soda half filled with ice and then another cup of coffee or water for that entire time. Bring water or a beverage and food with you. The seats are very uncomfortable for a person who is short is stature they do not fit the neck properly and you cannot recline far enough to be comfortable.,,,Economy,,,2,4,3,3,,,2,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Y Mullings,United States,10/9/2013,The pilot claimed to have have miscalculated his fuel needs of Flight US3280 leaving San Antonio to Charlotte and so about 10 minutes outside of Charlotte needed to make an emergency stop at Spartanburg to get fuel. After approximately 30 minutes on the ground we were told we had fuel and would be taking off shortly ten minutes later the pilot announced that he had again miscalculated our fuel need so we needed to wait for another fuel truck to give us even more fuel. After about a total delay of an hour we finally got back in the air and arrived in Charlotte at which time all the passengers who had missed connecting flights were sent to various hotels to await morning flights. I left Charlotte the next morning at 9.30 for Minneapolis my final destination still outraged by the seeming unconcern for the needless danger that this pilot and crew had for the safety and convenience of the passengers.,,,Economy,,,3,1,0,0,,,2,0

On the return trip from Barcelona to Louisville (10/6/13) the situation was very difficult. We were late leaving Barcelona so there was necessarily a rush through Customs and Security. We already had our boarding passes confirmed from the day before. When we arrived on time at the Philadelphia gate to go on to Charlotte our seats had been given away. What raises questions for us is that when we deplaned in Philadelphia an agent handed us a possible change of flights. Was that because our seats were already given away or because we had to go through Customs etc. and it was unlikely that we would make it?,,,Economy,,6,4,4,4,4,,,3,1

This is the 3rd time I used US Air's direct flight for my home town Philadelphia to Tel Aviv The plane was new and the seats had adequate leg room. I prefer the 2x4x2 seating configuration on the A 330 over the 2x5x2 or 3x3x3 configuration of the B777. The on demand entertainment system had a good list of programing. The food was not very good but that is to be expected and they ran out of one of the breakfast options on the return flight. The best part of the flight though were the flight attendants.

On return trip upgraded to Envoy class and other then larger seats the service and food offerings were not one would expect for the additional cost.

The reason we were delayed were long lines at check-in the computer system not being able to find our legitimate reservation another long line to speak with a live agent followed by a long line at security.

We arrived on time with baggage as one expects but the cabin service experience was poor particularly on the return transatlantic leg. The A330 has an outdated interior and insufficient lavatories. The seat back entertainment was difficult to use and the meals very small. The banana muffin and nothing else for breakfast was a joke. The crew were embarrassed to serve it.

Delays and mechanical issues are par for the course with this airline and they didn't ""disappoint."" Take off from PHL was delayed three hours. But what has convinced me to never fly with them again is the treatment by the flight crew during both the delay and the flight.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,Amanda Schoenthaler,United States,10/3/2013,My husband and I went to Aruba for our honeymoon a few weeks ago. We will never fly with them again! The middle of July comes around and we receive a phone call from US Airways saying they cancelled the flight we booked so we needed to choose a different flight. The only two options available were to either leave and come back the same dates but the travel time was 2 days worth each way or to leave a day early and get a hotel to be able to make it on the next flight leaving the following morning. The second option was our only reasonable choice out of the two. By leaving a day early this meant that my husband and I were going to have to miss an additional day's worth of work. We asked the agent if we could be compensated with a free hotel stay or for our bags and her answer was no. When we get to the baggage check in counter they tell us that we still need to pay for our bags. We stood there arguing with them that we already paid for our bags online. 30 minutes later this was finally straightened out. On our way back from Aruba we ran into the same issue with baggage fees (which we ended up having to pay for twice). We fly into Philadelphia to find out that our flight to Chicago has been delayed 5 hours which puts us getting into Chicago at around 2.00 am. We still had a flight to get on out of Chicago at 8.00 am. They apologize and said it was a staffing issue and that there were no other flights leaving the airport except that one.

There were no problems with my flight from NYC to Philly however that's where the luck ran out. There was an issue with downsizing the aircraft at Philly and so numerous passengers were left stranded I had been told I may have to wait for another flight tomorrow - which thankfully was not the case in the end. Having finally made it onto the flight and taking off an hour later than expected it didn't take much time to realise it was going to be a long journey home. The aircraft itself was tiny two lanes of 3 seats each which I have never encountered on an international flight before. It was cramped the food was awful and the attendants were difficult to deal with disgruntled and overall not welcoming in the slightest.

Economy seating on the first flight was cramped and uncomfortable and inflight crew were unfriendly. Felt more like an overnight bus service. Service on second flight was significantly better but aircraft didn't have any inflight entertainment - not even drop down screens.

Other than a little more leg room no real discernible difference than coach. Food was bad service was nowhere close to first class or business class. They had two meal selections but when they got to me there was only one. Mind you there were only 12 people in first class. There is absolutely no inflight entertainment. Very odd for a modern carrier. Flight attendant told me they got rid of inflight players because of the cost and weight. Seriously if that is why they got rid of it then they are apparently the only ones. If they are cutting costs that much I'd rather fly another airline who cares about the passenger experience. If flying coach probably ok if you get a really good deal. If business or first class definitely not worth it.,,,First Class,,1,2,3,1,1,,,1,0

I sat in a 'window seat' yet there was no window. Apparently this is a quirk several of the front rows in the old 767s. Food was poor and very little. Guests are offered only a single glass of wine at no charge and this comes out of a paper bottle. Breakfast consisted of a nothing but a small banana muffin. Cabin crew never came around with water or snacks in between meals. In-flight entertainment was non existent. No magazines offered except for the US Airways magazine. Their airport Club lounges are little better than their actual flights. No food offered beyond chips and a few olives. Alcohol is strictly limited. I will try to avoid this airline at all costs particularly as the 767s are scheduled to be in service for another 4 years.

Slight delay at PHL due to thunderstorms. Very disappointed that PHL to SFO (5.5 hours) wasn't deemed worthy of inflight entertainment. This leg of the journey was made worse by the ridiculous attitude of so many UIS fliers who take so much baggage on the plane and then moan because there is no where to store it all.

The flight is quite long 8 hours and 4.45 hours. The seats were ok we had enough room as long as the person in front of us did not change his seat setting to lay down. The main thing is the plane we were in flew from Amsterdam to Philly with no personal entertainment it had overhead screens with poor quality video which you could hardly see from the window seat. I think for such long flights personal entertainment is a must have we were really disappointed and did not expect this especially not since we were used to all of that with Delta and United. So we arrived in Philly and the transfer to the new plane went well. We got on our new plane an A321 from Philly to LA. Flight time 4.45 minutes.

Our main consideration was how the seats would be for nearly eight hours and I have to say that they were very comfortable with a substantial amount of leg-room. The food on the way out was excellent not quite so good on the way back but still OK. The personal entertainment on offer was very impressive and the cabin staff polite and friendly.

No meal on any flight and zero in flight entertainment on any flight. Drinks were served in plastic cups in First Class. The seats were fine but US Airways needs to be put out of their misery. I hope that the merger with American goes ahead and the service on the merged airline is stepped up because right now the domestic/ North American product on US Airways is two-star not three.

Our issues with US Airways is not with their international service it is with their horrific domestic service and the worst customer service experience imaginable. We live less than 2 hours from the Philadelphia airport and spent twice as much time as we did on the plane from London Heathrow to our home. They're cancelled all flights to our local airport and after 13 hours in an airport less than 2 hours from our home we had to rent a car (at our own expense) to drive home because US Airways cannot complete a transaction.

Finally got to Des Moines. Two days later Des Moines to Charlotte - delayed no idea why.

When I boarded most of the overhead compartments were open - several were empty most were less than half full. Had to collect bag from baggage claim when I got to Philadelphia but at least I didn't have to pay for it. Philadelphia to Boston was slightly delayed because of a check engine light that came on after we were all boarded.

US Airways flights depart from by far the worst part of FRA airport (and one of the worst areas of any airport anywhere).

Food was fundamentally inedible but I was grateful to have brought my own. Crews were mostly friendly and helpful. Flight seemed to be a non-stop sales pitch to buy duty free upgraded snacks etc. I thought several times that this unnecessarily disturbed what could have been a serene flight. Had the new Airbus planes both ways. Someone had broken off the tip of their headphones in the receptacle and the poor FA could not remove it even after returning with tweezers.

The meal was edible but very small and disappointing. On the second flight the crew was nicer but than again they are not US airways because the flight was operated by skywest. I had a 3 hour layover in Phoenix and even though I had paid for first class I was only allowed into the lounge if I gave them more money.,,,First Class,,3,3,4,2,1,,,2,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,E Birman,United Kingdom,7/30/2013,"SFO-PHL-FRA trying US Airways for the first time after being rebooked ""from"" them onto other airlines due to delays. Surprised with how decent they are. Both flights had roomy (though not very comfortable) seats excellent service on-board and arrived on time/early.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,A Johnston,United States,7/24/2013,Very frustrating experience with US Air when flying to Glasgow last week. Our traveling parties were meeting in PHL to connect to the same transatlantic flight. Both flights delayed due to weather but they go in to PHL at around the same time. Our flight then sat out on the tarmac for 1.5 hrs because they didn't have a gate for us. While we were stuck out there the captain kept saying all flights out were grounded so we would make our connections but that wasn't true as mine left leaving me stranded. Next flight waited for passengers to come in from a delayed flight. Why couldn't they do that for me? I finally made it to Glasgow the next day via London but missed the first day of vacation. On the way back our flight was delayed 2 hours due to maintenance and the next one was as well. On top of all this the staff were rude pushy and the flight attendants were surly the meals were gross and the TV sound did not work throughout so that was 7 hours with nothing to watch. They also kept running out of drinks and food by the time they reached our seats. If I can help it I will never fly US Air again!,,,Economy,,,3,1,2,0,,,1,0

Sunday morning went to airport realizing that they had booked my 16 daughter on a different flight to DC! Ended up renting a car and driving. Went back to airport on Monday 7/22 to catch my flight to LAX. Flight from Providence was late again and I missed my connection again.

We paid $99.00 each for ""Choice"" seats 24A and 24B. These were considered choice seats by the airline because they are Emergency Exit seats with the extra leg room. Unfortunately they are directly behind the lavatories.

The connecting flight to PTI was delayed as there was no fuel in the aircraft then an engine failed on start up. The Captain kept us informed as the engineers tried to fix it and an hour later we boarded a replacement airframe. On the return there was an hour delay at Philadelphia due to the aircraft being ""too hot in the cabin"" as it had been sat in the sun all day but the staff kept us informed of progress. What I did appreciate was that the bags went straight through and were ready to collect straight away. There is always room for improvement but I think these guys should focus a bit more on the maintenance - get the aircraft ready earlier and make sure it is serviceable before the flight - not wait until everyone is at the gate waiting to board.",,,Economy,,8,4,5,3,4,,,4,1

I went to the Phoenix counter to just get a brush off and were told that another flight was leaving San Diego to Hawaii that day. By the time we arrived in San Diego that morning we had been left stranded. I will never take a flight to San Diego nor will I fly US Airways. They offered to fly us out 2 days later.

Once again they have cancelled our flight from the island into Charlotte and we will not make our flight to Phoenix. The explanation given was ""weather"" in Charlotte.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,A Reed,United States,7/14/2013,Have always traveled using U.S. Airways usually from Charlotte NC to NYC. Last year entrusted them with our 16 year old traveling alone to Paris for a month. This year we traveled as a family to Paris and will be using them again in August as they now have a direct flight from Charlotte NC to Dublin Ireland. Have never had any trouble with this airline. Luckily no bad weather so flights have always been on time. My only complaint is on domestic flights they let people with huge carry-on luggage board and they fill up the available overhead spaced. I have had to check my regulation size carry on bag on a couple of occasions for lack of room. They don't seem to care what size your carry on bag is. Also food is awful but this is probably true of most airlines. Staff have always been friendly and helpful.,,,Economy,,10,4,4,1,5,,,5,1

PHL-FRA was a brand new Airbus 330 in fact only 4 weeks old so the aircraft itself was in order except the staff. Apart from one crew member all others were rude and any request from passengers seemed like bother. Apart from surly crew drinks were available for free except alcohol and food was just awful.

Once boarded the flight was delayed 35 mins and information given by captain. It was all aged male crew. The crew were polite and friendly enough to cater most of the needs. The big change I experienced that drinks were unlimited compared to past where you had to buy drinks. Crew made about 3 to 4 rounds for drinks and later only seen during breakfast round. Being an old aircraft there were no personal TV but they played three different movies on those ceiling attached TV's. They also loaded my requested meal which was compared to none but trash.

When we presented our boarding passes we were told that our seats were cancelled as they didn't think we would make the flight. I was traveling with my elderly mother so I insisted that they get us on that flight. In the end they found seats for most of us but I had to sit separately from my mother and kids. To add insult to injury some people did not get on the flight although there were still empty seats. They cancelled our seats and put us all through turmoil for nothing.

The TV/video system does not respond to touch and in order to make something happen you practically have to pound on the screen - obviously affecting the person sitting in the seat in front of you. The restrooms were filthy. Our flight was canceled from PHL to IND because of weather and the agents rescheduling us were rude. We were re-scheduled for a flight 12 hours later which turned out to be the best scenario for our group (43 of us). Most of us had luggage that did not make it until the next day.

I bought return flights to Boston with a connection through Philadelphia. On arrival in Philadelphia (which is a hub for US Airways seemingly) our connection was cancelled with no notice to passengers waiting at the gate. 20 mins after the flight was due to go the sign above the gate was still saying 'On Time'. We were told initially that all other flights were booked out that evening except for another 6 hours later which had no guarantee's of leaving. Eventually exhausted we agreed to layover for the night in a nearby hotel on US Airways expense. We flew the next days 18 hrs late. On our return flight via Philadelphia we were delayed on the runway 2 hours in Boston and arrived in Philadelphia 5 mins before our connection was to leave. They never held back the flight even though a substantial number of flights from Boston that evening had a large number of people travelling on that flight. Again we had to layover for the night.

Not sure if the fault was with poorly trained agents or a lousy system but the wait time was inexcusable. Then once we (finally) got on the plane we were delayed another 20 minutes while the baggage handlers arranged and rearranged the luggage in the storage area below the cabin.

Transatlantic legs in A330 much better than domestic segments by A320 within the USA. Food onboard in long haul fine served a glass of wine for free if requested which is an improvement. Breakfast tasty if only lacking in quantity. On 5 hour domestic flights only water and 1 non alcoholic drink served plus coffee/snack on outbound. Effectively operates a no frills model domestically even if you travel on a transatlantic ticket. They should issue free vouchers at least for people travelling long haul although no charge for checked bags on such ticket. AVOD installed on transatlantic temperamental but did work and headsets now free. Would not pay a premium to fly this carrier but as price paid for an open jaw return significantly lower than more premium carrier options was worth doing. All check in queues quite short made to use self service at SFO but system could not find our reservation and had to see agent anyway.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,K Burgess,United Kingdom,5/28/2013,LHR-PHL and PHL-LHR. Absolutely no complaints. On-time. Excellent seat in envoy class. Friendly service and good food. Wines not as good as BA and no Champagne pre-take off or in-flight only sparkling Italian Prosecco. Lounge in PHL inferior to BA's but US Airways use the Star Alliance lounge at LHR which is good. Would use again if the price was right.,,,Business Class,,9,5,5,4,4,,,5,1

Flew economy seats were comfortable enough although the rows are close together. cabin crew on all flights very pleasant; international crew did an especially nice job. International in-flight entertainment in economy is very nice. Would fly again.,,,Economy,,8,4,5,4,5,,,4,1
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Justin Chow,United States,5/21/2013,Flight 38 (LAX to CLT) this past week. My sister who was visiting from out of country had her flight delayed because of some issue with the cabin crew and almost missed her connecting flight. Her baggage was delivered on a later flight to our hotel which was the least they could do. Our customer service rep was very professional and helpful in assisting us. US Airways is a great way to fly on a budget but they need to fix issues like this or no amount of value can make it up.,,,Economy,,5,2,3,2,1,,,4,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,K Butler,United States,5/21/2013,"Seat 24F Flight 1471. The seats in back are made for people who are less than 5"" tall and 120lbs. They install the seat so that your shoulder is up against the window panel which shoves you into the person next to you. You cant recline the seat and it is installed cockeyed so that your back knows you are tilted forward the whole ride long. I am glad it was only for an hour or so. People in front of me chimed in about sitting on top of one another. Paid for preferred access and watched the TSA line move like lightning while preferred access stood there like idiots paying for a service that is non existent. When you try to upgrade a seat to first class you loose the $ for the first upgrade. Fix that seat so it is flat and not tilting forward.",,,Economy,,6,1,4,4,0,,,4,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,M Taylor,United States,5/20/2013,3/4 of my scheduled flights had serious issues. 4th flight I didn't take - my husband and I opted to take a rental car. First flight was taxiing to the runway we went back to the gate and changed flights. Replacement plane was fine. Connecting flight delayed due to a problem with the fuelling truck and then had an aborted take-off. We had to wait over an hour until they put us on a different plane at the opposite end of the airport. On the returning flight from Cancun we were notified mid-air over the Atlantic that there was some kind of electrical issue and that we had to make a cautionary landing in Miami. We were in Miami on a hot plane for 3 hours. Flight attendants did not check on us. They didn't come by with water. We had to go get it from the back where they were filing cups. Finally we left again and were served 2 tiny cookies. We of course missed our connecting flight in Philly. They threw a voucher at us for a hotel 15 miles away. By that point everything in the airport was closed in regards to food and we had nothing to eat all day. We tried calling customer service only to be told repeatedly that they have no phone support for such issues.,,,Economy,,,3,2,0,2,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,D Lynn Kurt,Canada,5/20/2013,"Recent experience on YYZ-PHL-CDG-PHL-YYZ was awful. Ignoring luggage issues on both in and outbound flights the ground service and scheduling were terrifying. Confirmed flights were cancelled or rescheduled without notice (email or text messages were received after the fact) gates were changed an average of 3x per flight all flights delayed (in some cases cancelled altogether) - my wife an I ended up on separate flights! - and departure information was inconsistent - i.e. big electronic display says flight gate F33 at 7.10pm little concourse display says gate F27 at 5.35pm and actual gate sign says 6.35pm and attendant says ""Oh the displays aren't updated very often"". The overall experience - coming and going - was flabbergasting. It's hard to understand how an organization can be so broken. I think what startled me the most is that the ground staff had so little regard for the degree in which they were trashing people's schedules vacations honeymoons etc. In fairness I'll say that the actual flight (once we got on one) was fine - nothing special but nothing horrible either - but getting to the flight transferring between flights luggage handling luggage problem handling responsiveness to client's was just plain horrible verging on criminal.",,,Economy,,,3,2,3,2,,,2,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,F Aguilo,United States,5/20/2013,I am long time US flyer with over 326000 miles earned on this airline I know the airline and its product and policies well and I must say I will do everything I can to never fly USAir (or American if the post-merger product is anything like USAir) again. Staff on long haul international flights (PHL-LHR) and (LHR-PHL) are not only rude and unprofessional they seem to have disdain for their customers. One does not expect personalized attention in Economy but even in this class of service this was still a $1400 ticket and quite frankly I expect better service for that kind of money. Multiple requests to have a personal wheelchair stored in the cabin coat closet (as every other international airline does) were ignored on not one but 3 separate occasions. Disabled passengers and mothers with infants were treated with complete disdain on both US Airways Flight 728 (5/17/13) and US Airways flight 729 (5/20/13). I fly frequently and am generally pretty tolerant of the hassles of flying nowadays however flying on US Airways between the US and Europe was truly the low point of my trip. The fact that both the outbound and the return flights were characterized by such poorly trained staff tells me this is an endemic problem. Their international product truly is garbage no matter what the fare is.,,,Economy,,1,3,1,2,3,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Edwin Arce,United States,5/20/2013,Was scheduled to fly from NY to Orlando for my first child's graduation. Flight from NY was rescheduled due to mechanical problem. Rescheduled to fly from NY to Philadelphia connecting to another flight from Philadelphia to Orlando arrived in Philadelphia while awaiting at the gate They closed the doors never asked me anything were very unpleasant to deal with and after complaining they finally rescheduled me for another flight that was late to Orlando which resulted in me being late for my Daughters graduation. When I spoke with someone on the phone all I got was a run-around and how sorry they truly are but there is nothing we can. Supervisor after supervisor nobody was willing to make the experience even a little pleasant.,,,Economy,,,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Francisco Hernandez,Puerto Rico,5/19/2013,This is the first and last time I'll fly with US Air. The delays are ridiculous. I've never seen an airline with so many problems with their planes. Both flights I took to go stateside were delayed and both returning were also delayed. I missed my last connection.

us-airways,US Airways customer review,B Jenkins,United States,5/19/2013,"When I did my online check-in it asked me if I wanted to upgrade to First Class for $300. I have travelled to East Asia (China) a couple times - first time I flew coach - 3 seats wide. After the 12 hour flight home I promised myself I would never do that again. The next time went to China on United I upgraded to Business Class - wow what a difference - lay flat seats are what traveling that distance was meant to be. I upgraded my wife and myself to first class for the 6 hour flight. US Air flies a old 757 to Honolulu but I will say for me the $300 was well worth it. The seats are the old school First Class seats big ""lazy boy"" style which recline maybe 10-degrees and no foot rest but very comfy and roomy. No duvets or pillows like business class to China but normal aircraft pillow and blanket sufficed for me. Hot meal service was fine - served on glass plates - two choices (chicken or ravioli) - airplane food - United business class to China had excellent food - this was more one step up from a TV dinner but sufficed. Ice cream for desert. After dinner had a nice nap and awoke to a basket of all kinds of snacks being passed out. Plenty of drinks readily available. So was it worth $300 each for wife and I to upgrade to first class? Yes but if upgrading means you are going to have to cutback on your spending once you get to Hawaii - definitely wouldn't recommend that. Hope upgrades are available for my flight home! Tip: if you can get seats in 2F and 2 D these are bulkhead and more leg room and the shared TV is on the wall in front of you.",,,First Class,,7,4,5,3,1,,,4,1
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Colleen Rando,United States,5/16/2013,The only reason we took US Airways was because they had a non-stop to Punta Cana from Philadelphia. They charge you $25 for your luggage and lost my daughter's. We came back 5/14/13 she just got it today 5/16/13. The seats were hard and there wasn't any entertainment. It has to be the cheapest airline going. They asked if anyone wanted bottle water I said yes they gave me a Dixie cup of water. When he served me my soda he spilt it on me and didn't even say he was sorry!,,,Economy,,1,1,1,1,1,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,J Blasini,Puerto Rico,5/14/2013,Flew from San Juan to Philadelphia connecting to Los Angeles LAX. This airline deserves to go down to the ranks of Ryanair and one star less. The PHL Agents are the most bored staff in the USA and service onboard long haul Caribbean and transcon flights limited on one and only one beverage service and that's it. What do FA's the rest of the flight? Southwest just entered service into SJU from MCO/TPA/BWI and FLL and flights are extremely full. Will avoid US Airways at all costs even if the fare at another airline is higher.,,,Economy,,,4,1,1,4,,,1,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,B Dacchille,United States,5/13/2013,My recent domestic flight was so unpleasant. Late departures on all 4 legs of my trip. On last flight departing Philadelphia the gate staff were rude disorganized and apparently poorly trained. One member of the gate team showed a complete lack of compassion for a very young mother traveling alone with her infant. Body language displayed toward this young lady was deplorable. Seat was comfortable - looked to have been recently refurbished. Poor application of carry-on luggage policies travelers carrying over-sized bags and 3+ items were completely ignored.

All of this happened during one international flight. I had connecting flights for what should have been 4 flights (2 there 2 back) every single plane was late. Nothing was offered. Overall just not my cup of tea. I will never fly that airline again!,,,Economy,,,2,1,1,0,,,2,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,Nimesh Modak,United States,5/12/2013,US Airways Philadelphia-Athens Economy Class. Just awful. But that was to be expected. US still flies ancient 767s on this route. Probably the worst transatlantic carrier around today. No entertainment system (they couldn't even get the shared TV right with movies being cut off half way and replaced with a new one) seats were old and visibly broken. I had planned to work on the flight when I discovered that my reading light was broken I was simply informed that I should have told the staff before we took off. Typical rude and unprofessional attitude that I have come to expect from the airline. No loss seeing them leave Star Alliance.,,,Economy,,1,1,2,2,1,,,2,0
us-airways,US Airways customer review,M Andy,United States,5/12/2013,Last year I flew across the United States 28 times for work as well as flights to other parts of the US. I saw over 15 airports and flew in coach and first class (once my status got up to Gold I flew first class almost every week). I never had a cancelled flight or a missed connection and I was never more than 30 minutes late to my destination. Sometimes the flights were annoying but that was because of other passengers not the staff. My only complaint about US Air is that they don't have the extra legroom seats like United so you are forced to try to grab exit rows or pray for a bump to first class.,,,Economy,,9,3,5,4,0,,,4,1
